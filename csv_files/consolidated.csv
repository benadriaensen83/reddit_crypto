&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

I have many issues with Bluesfest. I don’t go, in fact, because of them. 

But there are blues acts each and every year, if you look for them. 

If you want a festival in Ottawa that is a ‘pure’ blues festival, it would be at most one weekend, attract an audience about a tenth of the size of Bluesfest, and feature pretty much a rotating cast of a few main stage headliners 

Year 1: Buddy Guy / Keb’ Mo’  
Year 2: Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi / Joe Bonamassa  
Year 3: Robert Cray / Larkin Poe 

None of the festivals (with the possible exception of Chamberfest) can stick tight within their genre anymore. You need bums in seats to buy the passes and drink the beer. And if you don’t do that, then you disappear quickly. The 2019 Jazz Festival had Chicago and The Roots as their headliners.

Largest CD release party in human history. 100k people showed up on the streets of Athens, GA.

They're the kind of band that people drop everything in their lives to follow. I've traveled 16k miles to see them since last June.

They are an improvisational rock group from Athens, GA. In a similar vein to the Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead.

A truly outstanding group of musicians, Panic puts on an incredible show every night with lyrically rich material that spans some of them most important parts of the human experience all wrapped in mind melting guitar solos from the master Jimmy Herring and bomb drops from bassist David Schools.

So you play what is basically a gimmick guitar which plays entirely different and employs a completely different technique from a traditional guitar and you wonder why you don't sound like the people you listen to. 

""I play guitar""

Congratulations, I've been playing for 10+ years.

""Show me a single person on earth that can play a guitar like Derek Trucks""

You absolutely can.  Guitar is easier to learn than ever thanks to youtube tutorials and programs like guitar pro. Tom Quayle, Justin King, Charles Caswell, Sarah Longfield and Leonardo Guzman are just a few excellent guitarists all extremely proficient in entirely different styles.  Clearly you haven't looked very hard if you actually believe nobody can play like the guys you mentioned.  There are tons of guitarists who can and do.

""you can’t just force your way into that level of tone and expression through practice. And the idea that you can is horribly naive.""

The fact that you actually believe something as silly as this tells me you lack discipline. Not a single one of the guitarists you mentioned was born with raw talent, most started playing and studying music when they were children.  And the reason they became great is because they actually worked at it and thought about it enough to not only practice but practice efficiently and innovate unique sounds.",,2020-01-31 03:57:11,1580439431,,1580440127.0,{},fg26if0,False,t3_evmy9m,False,True,t1_ffzlmje,/r/toptalent/comments/evmy9m/derek_trucks_makes_his_guitar_cry_whilst_bb_king/fg26if0/,1580441582,1,True,0.9681,,False,toptalent,t5_3ptyd,0.0,

Derek has gone on tour with the Allman Brothers Band several times, formed the Derek Trucks Band, and is now a member of the Tedeschi Trucks Band with his wife.

I would recommend checking out his live albums, especially Live at the Regal and Live in Cook County Jail. These are all blues guitarists.

75,[],,1dvs_bastard,,,,[],,,,text,t2_hltn0,False,False,[],"I'll have a go at it. I've played slide for quite a few years and I started because of this man. He is my favorite guitarist.

As many people have mentioned it is the nuances of the notes. Derek voices the notes in such a way that his guitar ""sings."" With blues, it's not so much about how many notes you can fit into one measure with extreme and insane technicality. I have mad respect for the people that do that (the Guthrie Govan's, John Petrucci's, etc of the world). But how much feeling you can put into one or two notes. That can actually be quite difficult to do. David Gilmore was another master at it. He wasn't technical like some of the shredders but you could feel his playing. To be clear, Derek can play technical riffs and at great speed all with his fingers. In his early albums with his band the Derek trucks band you hear a lot of jazz, Coltrane type roots. He isn't always working a slide. He has since slowed down since joining his wife in a band and getting older.

Now if you have never played slide, it can be hard to appreciate the technicality of it on a guitar. It's very difficult to hit the right note or notes without being sharp or flat, while also muting all the other strings that the slide is hitting simultaneously. Anyone who has never played slide that begins to learn can tell you the pains of getting that down. It sound like nails on a chalk board the first few months of practice. Hitting the right notes takes a lot of practice. Hitting the right notes and giving it feeling is even harder.

But here this man is making his guitar belt like a soloist choir singer in a church band. He is very melodic in his playing. His vibrato at just the right times and for just the right durations is another thing that sticks out to people into this kind of music. It's masterfully done and not easy to replicate. He also has some of the best volume control you will ever hear in a musician and he does it all with his hands and volume knob. He plays straight into an amp with no bugs on the floor.

Another thing is his ear. His ear is amazing. He plays with his eyes closed a lot of times and on slide it's really fucking hard bc you can't feel the frets through a slide. There are no denominations with the slide. It's essentially a fretless instrument. Again that perfect note is difficult to hit. You'll also see him occasionally tune in the middle of a song bc he has the impeccable ability to pinpoint flat or sharp notes from his amazing pitch control.

His ability to create tension in his playing with a slide is another thing that speaks to me as a player. ""Keep on Growing"" live at the fox Oakland theater by Tedeschi Trucks Band shows some of the skill. Again for more technical stuff I would check out his earlier stuff with the Derek Trucks Band. 

To top this off he's been playing like this since he was around 9 years old and been on the road for just as long. You can see some stuff on YouTube with him as a youngin. His music isn't for everybody. Most my friends can't see the talent either but I can assure it's there.

I hold Derek Trucks in a special place in my heart. My dad took me to see the Derek Trucks Band when they were touring Song Lines at the House of Blues in Myrtle Beach many years ago. I learned to play the guitar from my dad but I was into Steve Vai and GNR at the time. When he said, ""Hey come with me to see this show. I think you'll like him a lot,"" being a teenager I was like, nah. I'm good. Thanks though. He basically begged me and I gave in when I asked if my buddy could go too. He said, ""Uh yea, everyone needs to see this guy play."" 

Best decision of my life. I was absolutely floored by his skills, style, and tone. First time I've ever seen a slide player and someone play with their fingers. It was from that point on I decided I was going to learn slide guitar. Took me a while but I've got it down at least to where people say I've got some Derek chops at shows we play. I've also seen him as many times as possible since then.

Fast forward to a few years ago, the Tedeschi Trucks Band came to Wilmington and I was lucky enough to score some tickets to go with my (now) wife and best friend I've been playing guitar with for 18ish years (not the one that went to Myrtle Beach concert). They put on a hell of a show but I noticed it was rather short. I wasn't too mad because I heard they were just stopping through basically on their way to their next show and, hell, it was still amazing. Every musician up there is absolutely phenomenal.

Well the band came out basically for a meet and greet! Holy crap! The venue is rather small here in Wilmington so I assume that's why they did it. I'm a shy guy. Don't really like to pester or bother people. My wife on the other hand is a social fucking butterfly and can strike up a conversation with anyone and everyone. I also always get a hard copy ticket mailed to me just so on the off chance I could get a member of whatever band I'm seeing to sign it. Which is again really difficult being a shy bastard. 

Well, my wife yoinked the ticket out of my hands and made a bee-line with my buddy straight for Kofi Burbridge (RIP) who was the first out. My man was basically in the stands by the stage. They spoke with him for 5 or 10 min about our band and he was genuinely interested in everything they were saying an was really down to earth...so I heard. My timid ass was still in the stands in my seat, watching with envy. I regret not talking to him that now that he's passed. But he did sign the ticket and was really, really nice.

Then Derek and Susan came out closer to their tour bus. My wife came and basically drug me out of my seat and said come on. At this point everyone still in the venue had made their way over to them and I got in the back of the crowd. My wife and buddy started making their way to the front and so I reluctantly followed. Well, when my buddy made it to within about 5 feet of him he yells, ""Hey Derek, just want you to know my buddy plays a mean slide guitar and it is all because of you, man. Your his favorite guitarist."" 

The unthinkable happened. He said ""Wow thanks man. Where is he?"" And my buddy pointed at me. Derek then proceeded to walk out the 5 or so feet into the crowd and handed me his slide. He said something to me along the lines of ""Here you go man. Thanks."" but at this point my brain was overloaded and I was star-struck. Mouth agape. I muster out an, ""oh. my. god. Dude! Thanks!"" and look at my wife. She's crying, lol.

My father passed away in 2011 unexpectedly to a heart attack when I was 24 and our main bonding point was music. More specifically the music from this man. When I asked her (later, when at home) why she was crying she said it was because she knew how much that moment must have meant to me. And she was completely right. I wish he could have been there because he would have been if he was still around. 

While I was still star struck after he gave me the slide she squeaked a question through her tears and asked Derek if she could take a picture. He said yes, probably because her tears..that probably made him uncomfortable, haha. 

I still have that slide. I still have the ticket with Kofi, Derek's and Susan's signature. And still have that picture. I can post it later if anyone read this far and is interested.  Again sorry for the length of the story. Anyone and everyone should see this band and this man play guitar though.

Eastern music can be a fresh source of ideas which are applicable in western settings. The major modes are ubiquitous in both hemispheres. The guitar work of Derek Trucks is a great example of blues playing informed by, in his case, the study of the sarod. I agree if you want to improvise in a rock setting that rock backing tracks can be a useful tool but the drone is a universal medium for improvisation, forming the backbone of modal music everywhere, including much of rock. Even the last track which featured extended tonic harmonies is at core a metered drone for those sections. Having only a drone as accompaniment is not a good way to develop a sense of rhythm and this the main thing to worry about I think. However, featuring a drone would allow beginners especially to really hear all the intervals at play and get more mileage out of the familiar scales.

&gt; Hard-rocking blues-soaked guitarist/vocalist/song-writer Tinsley Ellis sings and plays with the energy and soul of all the great Southern musicians who have come before him. Ellis attacks his music with rock power and blues feeling, following in the tradition of Deep South musical heroes Duane Allman, Freddie King, Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes. His live shows feature extended fretwork filled with melodic and rhythmic experimentation, in the spirit of jam bands like his friends Widespread Panic and The Allman Brothers. Atlanta Magazine declared Ellis ""the most significant blues artist to emerge from Atlanta since Blind Willie McTell."" 
Since first hitting the national scene with his Alligator Records debut, GEORGIA BLUE, in 1988, Ellis has toured non-stop and continued to release one critically acclaimed album after another. His stellar guitar work, always a staple of his live shows and CDs, is matched by his strong songwriting and powerful, soulful vocals. Tinsley's hometown paper, The Atlanta Journal Constitution, calls his music, ""a potent, amazing trip through electric blues-rock.""

&gt; Ellis made five critically acclaimed albums for Alligator between 1988 and 1997 before recording for the Capricorn and Telarc labels. His high-energy LIVE-HIGHWAYMAN, the long-awaited live album his fans have been demanding for years, marked his return to Alligator records. ""Tinsley is one of the finest younger generation blues rockers. He's made great albums for us in the past, and we're excited to have him back in the Alligator family. He's great in the studio, but even better live, so I'm really excited about this recording,"" said Iglauer.

&gt; Ellis' latest release on Alligator, MOMENT OF TRUTH, captures all the power and energy of his legendary live performances. His vocals reach new heights of soulfulness and expressiveness; his guitar playing is ferocious and relentless, but, when the mood calls for it, gentle and moving. What really sets the album apart, though, is the depth of Ellis’ songwriting. The material deals in matters both personal and universal and runs the gamut of human emotions. MOMENT OF TRUTH is Ellis’ most wide-ranging and inspired recording. 

&gt; Born in Atlanta in 1957, Ellis grew up in southern Florida and first played guitar at age eight. He found the blues through the backdoor of the British Invasion bands like The Yardbirds, The Animals, Cream, and The Rolling Stones. He especially loved the Kings--Freddie, B.B. and Albert--and spent hours immersing himself in their music. His love for the blues solidified when he was 14. At a B.B. King performance, Tinsley sat mesmerized in the front row. When B.B. broke a string on Lucille, he changed it without missing a beat, and handed the broken string to Ellis. After the show, B.B. came out and talked with fans, further impressing Tinsley with his warmth and down-to-earth attitude. By now Tinsley's fate was sealed; he had to become a blues guitarist. And yes, he still has that string.

&gt; Already an accomplished teenaged musician, Ellis left Florida and returned to Atlanta in 1975. He soon joined the Alley Cats, a gritty blues band that included Preston Hubbard (of Fabulous Thunderbirds fame). In 1981, along with veteran blues singer and harpist Chicago Bob Nelson, Tinsley formed The Heartfixers, a group that would become Atlanta's top-drawing blues band. Upon hearing LIVE AT THE MOONSHADOW (Landslide), the band's second release, The Washington Post declared, ""Tinsley Ellis is a legitimate guitar hero."" After cutting two more Heartfixers albums for Landslide, COOL ON IT (featuring Tinsley's vocal debut) and TORE UP (with vocals by blues shouter Nappy Brown), Ellis was ready to head out on his own. Ellis sent a copy of the master tape for his solo debut to Bruce Iglauer at Alligator Records. ""I had heard COOL ON IT,"" recalls Iglauer, ""and I was amazed. I hadn't heard Tinsley before, but he played like the guys with huge international reputations. It wasn't just his raw power; it was his taste and maturity that got to me. It had the power of rock but felt like the blues. I knew I wanted to hear more of this guy.""

&gt; GEORGIA BLUE, Tinsley's first Alligator release, hit an unprepared public by surprise in 1988. Critics and fans quickly agreed that a new and original guitar hero had emerged. ""Dazzling musicianship pitched somewhere between the exhilarating volatility of rock and roll and the passion of urban blues,"" raved the Los Angeles Times. Before long, Alligator arranged to reissue COOL ON IT and TORE UP, thus exposing Tinsley's blistering earlier music to a growing fan base."" The Chicago Tribune celebrated the release by saying, ""Ellis takes classic, Southern blues-rock workouts and jolts them to new life with a torrid axe barrage.""

&gt; Tinsley's next release, 1989's FANNING THE FLAMES, further expanded the guitarist's hero status. By now his talents as a songwriter equaled his guitar prowess. Guitar World shouted, ""Ellis stands alongside Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter, and that ain't just hype."" 1992's TROUBLE TIME added guests Peter Buck (R.E.M.) and keyboardist Chuck Leavell (Rolling Stones), and brought even more critical acclaim Ellis' way. The song &gt;Highwayman received airplay on commercial rock radio stations across the country. ""Alive, kicking and drenched in sweat,"" declared The Washington Post.

&gt; 1994's STORM WARNING was Ellis' true breakthrough. Recorded live in the studio with his road-savvy band and produced by Eddy Offord (John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Yes), the album was a tour-de-force of smoking guitar workouts and radio-friendly blues rockers. Features and reviews ran in Rolling Stone, The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and in many other national and regional publications. His largest audience by far came when NBC Sports ran a feature on Atlanta's best blues guitarist during their 1996 Summer Olympic Coverage viewed by millions of people all over the world.

&gt; FIRE IT UP followed in 1997. Produced by the legendary Tom Dowd (Allman Brothers, Ray Charles), the album featured Ellis' blazing guitar playing and expressive, soulful vocals in better form than ever. With Dowd's deft production touch--along with Tinsley's fiery road band and a host of talented musicians, including famed bassist Donald ""Duck"" Dunn on seven songs--Ellis reached new heights, coming up with some of the best performances of his career. The Associated Press called the CD, ""A solid heaping of blues...a mixture of well-written originals and covers all held together with scorching guitar and a big voice to carry his sharply written lyrics.""

&gt; A move to Capricorn Records in 2000 saw Ellis revisiting his Southern roots with KINGPIN. Unfortunately, the label folded soon after the CD's release. In 2002, he joined the Telarc label, producing two well-received albums of soul-drenched blues-rock, HELL OR HIGH WATER and THE HARD WAY. All the while, Ellis never stopped touring. ""A musician never got famous staying home,"" he's quick to note.

&gt; Ellis has played in all 50 states, as well as Canada, Europe, Australia and South America. Whether he's out with his own band or sharing stages with The Allman Brothers, Robert Cray, Koko Taylor or Widespread Panic, he averages over 150 performances a year, bringing his fast-moving, high-energy, guitar-drenched performances to fans all over the world. Live, there's simply no one better at igniting a crowd, jamming with focus and purpose...

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

As far as learning is concerned, get your ii-V-I's down, in every key, major and minor, and learn all your mode patterns. Then you can delve into phrasing, planing, enclosures, Bebop scales and other jazzy chromatic stuff that'll add alot of flavor to your licks. Look around for cool new voicings and altered chords as well. Identify your altered notes (#2, b2, #5, b5, m11, etc), find out where they are in the scale and hit them on runs. Make sure you sync your landing notes appropriately as well. Altered notes should be played off beat while your landing notes play on chord changes (those notes are generally thirds and fifths). Learn as much about dominant chords as you can! They are so fucking versatile it's insane. Jazz is like a language and once you can get the [alphabet] scales down to where you can hear where you're going, you'll be able to start to form sentences [phrases].

First, go listen to B.B. King's ""Live at the Regal"".  One, you just should; it's an excellent album.  Two, listen to what the horns are doing.   While sometimes horns will take solos in blues, it's not nearly as much as in a jazz jam session.  Whoever's leading will feel obligated to throw solos around, so you'll do some.

As a blues horn player know what your job is much more background.  You'll play rhythms and long tones. You probably won't play the head.  But everything you do will serve to enrich the singer/lead guitarist, until perhaps it's time to solo.  Act like a back-up singer, and rest far more than you play.

Get good in the concert keys of E, G, A, D, and Bb, sometimes F.  Most tunes are written in those keys.  Don't worry about calling tunes, you won't be the one to do that.  Especially if this jam is at a bar or club of some kind.  If it's just folks jamming on their own in some room, maybe.  But if it's any kind of performance, there will be the leader of the session, or someone the leader trusts up there to make sure the tune isn't a goat rodeo.

Here's  a blues pro-tip.  Lay out the first time around on the form, almost every time, unless you've gotten to the point where you're sure of what you're doing.  

Here's a life pro-tip:  Forget everything you ever were ever taught about the blues scale.  It's not a scale, it's an awkward collection of pitches no one should ever play in succession.  Instead, play the pentatonic scale and bend pitches and add blue notes.  Remember:  Never play the blues scale.  Ever again.

Try to listen and emulate solos of some of the best blues guitar players.  B.B. King, again, as well as Albert King are great starts.  For people today, cop the styles of guitar players Susan Tedeschi and her husband Derek Trucks.  Listen to how the singers sing, because the guitar players are just trying to emulate that.  All good solos should have a vocal quality, even in jazz.

The landmark jazz trumpeter who's style and solos came the closest to jazz was Lee Morgan.  Listen to some of his soloing, and that will help.

Finally, listen listen listen to the blues.  Jazz players often know what the blues is in terms of form, but they rarely take the time to understand the style, thinking jazz will cover it. And hardcore dyed-in-the-wool blues guys know that and have a chip on their shoulder.

And you/re going to be characteristically wrong.  Again.  I saw Radiohead live for the first time in 1993 when they were still the opening band for James at the Oxford Apollo. The last time I saw them was at SummerSonic Tokyo in 2016.  In between I've seen them live six times on four continents over three decades.  

I've also studied music, played guitar for 28 years, been in more gigging bands than I can remember, played modest local festivals to audiences of a few thousand, and done a little session recording guitar work as a ""hobby job"" from time to time.

Spare me the amateur hour breakdown of what Johnny Greenwood's playing style is and isn't.  Unless you've got the video of him playing  ""dissonant, wrong, missed notes with bad timing"" you say he's famous for, that I'd still interested in, because I can't find any.

However, these legends of music and heavy hitters of music journalism are all dead wrong and misinformed though, because according to some done nothing nobody on Reddit called u/Pjautuvas, these guitarists are in fact: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ...not innovative, they're not unique and they're certainly not exceptional  songwriters. They're just gimmicky virtuoso guitar players...  

&amp;#x200B;

You saw it here first folks. Jimi Hendrix, unexceptional, unoriginal, lacking innovation, pointlessly gimmicky, poor songwriter. Now that's the wisdom of youth speaking.

&amp;#x200B;

I gave you more than a fair shot, kid. It's your own fault that neither myself, nor anyone else reading this will take your opinion seriously anymore, let alone the time to respond to it.

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan.

If you research that term you will learn what you want to learn about how to arrive at those more expressive intervals. I do agree with another poster that what you are trying to do is perhaps more accurately called Expressive Intonation - playing in a equal temperament context (which you can't avoid on a fretted guitar) but reaching for the more primal interval that ET only approximates/fudges. There is a long tradition of doing this in vocal groups like barbershop quartets and among skilled vocalists, slide guitarists, pedal steel guitarists, string-bending guitarists, fiddle players and other instruments that allow note-bending or access to notes not in ET in blues, gospel, folk, country, even rock. There is also obviously a tradition of truly just-intoned music all over the world and even in western folk musics that has continued in spite of ET, and it's kind of cool when you find the links between those musics and the use of expressive intonation in an ET context (like Derek Trucks digging into Qawwali and Hindustani slide. Also, I haven't really analyzed it, but I bet Sonic Youth and bands who use all sorts of open and alternate tunings  are hitting a lot of the purer just-intoned intervals by instinct and that's why their stuff packs such an emotional punch - they were probably fans of and influenced by Henry Partch and others like him).

The reason the pure intervals have so much emotional punch is because they are exact multiples (and fractions) of the root frequency.

Our modern tuning standard is A = 440 Hz. This is high E string 5th fret, but all the As on the guitar (tuned to 440) are whole numbers. So G string 2nd fret is 220 Hz, open A string is 110Hz. Obviously they occur in other places on the guitar as well. Thus key of A (maj, min, modal, doesn't matter) would be the easiest notes to start with as you train your ears. I have a tuner on my phone that tells me the frequency of the pitch I am playing.

So break out your calculator and and calculate the frequencies of the just intervals you want to work on. You can just use the ratios I have in the 2nd chart below. The 1st chart tells you what interval it is you are working on. The 3rd chart is all the intervals in key of C since it's easiest to understand, but we want key of A for ease of calculation, which is in the 4th chart.

I got this stuff from *Harmonic Experience* by Mathieu, but it's in other places too.

&amp;#x200B;

M6 | M3 | M7 | #4

P4 | **1** | P5 | M2

m2| m6 | m3 | b7

&amp;#x200B;

5/3 x | 5x | 15/8 x (=5\*3) | 45/32 x (=5\*3\*3)

4/3 x | **1** | 3x | 9/8 x (=3\*3)

16/15 x (= 1/5 \* 1/3) | 8/5 x (=1/5) | 6/5 x (=3/5) | 9/5 x (1/5 \* 3 \* 3)

&amp;#x200B;

A | E | B | F#

F | **C** | G | D

Db | Ab | Eb | Bb

F# | C# | G# | D#

D   | **A**   | E     | B

Bb | F    | C    | G

&amp;#x200B;

So say you want to practice a typical country/blues/rock major pentatonic style bend up to the M3. We can do this from B on the G string 4th fret. 220 Hz x 5/4 = 275 Hz. The  Pano tuner will tell you when you hit it. You can also grab the 5th fret 2nd and 1st string E and A notes to hit an A maj triad when you make the bend and that will also help your ear get the just M3.  You can do similar things with all the other intervals.

Also know that 7-limit intervals are used a lot too. 7/4 is a low b7 interval, for example, that musicians in the American and rock traditions reach for a lot. There are others too but I don't remember them.",,2019-12-29 21:44:54,1577652294,,1577653017.0,{},fcho3xq,False,t3_egslyx,False,True,t3_egslyx,/r/musictheory/comments/egslyx/what_do_you_call_it_when_you_tune_an_instrument/fcho3xq/,1577662031,1,True,0.9909,[],False,musictheory,t5_2qrjj,0.0,

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

&gt; Grace Potter &amp; the Nocturnals is an American rock band from Vermont. Formed in 2002 in Waitsfield by drummer Matt Burr, guitarist Scott Tournet, and singer Grace Potter, they began their career as an indie band, self-producing their albums and touring extensively in the jam bands and music festivals circuit, playing as many as 200 gigs in a year. In 2005 they signed for Hollywood Records and have subsequently released albums encompassing rock sub-genres such as blues rock, folk rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Their third, self-titled album (released in 2010) was a major commercial success, topping the iTunes charts and receiving international attention.

&gt; Grace Potter whose dynamic vocal ability has drawn comparisons to legends Bonnie Raitt, Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin and more recently Sheryl Crow and  Joan Osborne. Her unique style behind the Hammond B-3 and piano is also gaining widespread recognition. The original lineup included Scott Tournet (guitar/slide guitar), Matthew Burr (drums/percussion), and Bryan Dondero (upright/electric bass). After Dondero parted ways with the Nocturnals in March 2009, they brought in Catherine Popper (bass) and also added Benny Yurco (rhythm guitar).

&gt; They have toured with national acts such as Taj Mahal, Trey Anastasio, Dave Matthews Band, The Black Crowes, Derek Trucks, Gov't Mule and Robert Cray.  Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Susan Tedeschi (born 9 November 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American blues and soul musician who has received multiple Grammy Award nominations. She is known for her singing voice, guitar playing, and stage presence. Married to blues guitarist Derek Trucks, Tedeschi is also known for her current endeavor, Tedeschi Trucks Band (originally know as ""Soul Stew Revival""), a conglomeration of The Derek Trucks Band and assorted other musicians.

&gt; The Susan Tedeschi Band began in 1994 and featured Tom Hambridge and Adrienne Hayes. In 1995 Tedeschi began playing guitar and honing her skills. In December that year she released Better Days to regional audiences. Record contracts were difficult to keep together; however, recording sessions from 1997 were acquired by Richard Rosenblatt, and the band was signed to Tone-Cool Records and Just Won't Burn was released in February 1998 to rave reviews from blues publications.

&gt; During 1998 and 1999 Tedeschi toured extensively through out the United States and her spectacular stage presence and powerful voice drew larger crowds. Eventually Tedeschi was opening for John Mellencamp, B.B. King, Buddy Guy, The Allman Brothers Band, Taj Mahal and Bob Dylan. In 2000, Just Won't Burn reached gold record status, rare for such a production. She recorded two tracks with Double Trouble band members Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon for their album.

&gt; Tedeschi's voice has been described as a blend of Bonnie Raitt and Janis Joplin, though she explains this is due to sharing the same influences as the two. Her guitar playing is influenced by Buddy Guy, Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Freddie King and Doyle Bramhall.

&gt; Tedeschi grew up in Norwell, Massachusetts and attended the Berklee College of Music where she received her bachelor of music in composition and performance. Tedeschi had always been musically inclined, performing in musicals, singing for family members, and listening to her father's record collection. She formed a band in high school called the Smoking Section at age 15, sang in a Gospel choir at Berklee and began sitting in with local blues jams at venues in Boston. In 2001, she married Derek Trucks,  Allman Brothers guitar player, leader of The Derek Trucks Band, and nephew of founding Allmans drummer Butch Trucks. They have two children, Charlie and Sophia. They currently reside in Jacksonville,FL, and regularly collaborate on each other's albums. Read more on Last.fm.

It is easier to learn slide when you have a separate guitar setup specifically for slide. This means setting up for open tunings (I started with open G) with a slightly higher than average action with heavier strings. Sure, you can start out learning in standard tuning with a low action but it is more challenging so most people find it frustrating and give up. I toyed around with slide for years in frustration. I used an [old Harmony guitar](https://i.imgur.com/DYGK8if.jpg?2) with a high action, tuned it to open G and made a lot of progress quickly. 

Regarding open tunings vs standard, the direction to go depends a lot on your influences. There are some blues and blues-rock songs that just won't sound right to you in standard and vice versa. You can make them work, see players like Warren Hayes (standard) and Derek Trucks (open E), but it is more difficult to do well. Playing in standard will force you to learn good muting habits, leverage your current fretboard knowledge and provide more flexibility in what you can play. But you'll lose a lot of those really neat 4+ string chord tones and open string drones which are a key component of a lot of slide songs. I usually play slide in open G about 60% of the time and mostly standard after that.

As I mentioned, muting is the big part of playing slide. This is what you'll want to concentrate on developing so you build the mechanics and muscle memory to do it. Vibrato is another big element that you'll need to work on. If you can blend these into your practice routine, you'll make quicker progress. I prefer to practice individual slide licks over and over again, making sure I get these elements right.

 Slide selection is important. I probably have about 40 to 50 slides but I only have 3 or 4 I use regularly. I settled on a thick copper pipe slide cut to about 1 1/2 inches as my favorite. Try out a lot of them to find what works for you. One trick I use with my slides is to line the inside with moleskin to get a more comfortable fit and to absorb sweat. There are other materials that will work for this too.",,2019-12-21 01:37:58,1576888678,,,{},fbi27b9,False,t3_edhlmb,False,True,t3_edhlmb,/r/Guitar/comments/edhlmb/question_how_difficult_is_it_to_learn_playing/fbi27b9/,1576888679,1,True,0.992,[],False,Guitar,t5_2qi79,0.0,

They've released four studio albums, of which *Let Me Get By* is my favorite, but they're all good. Other songs of theirs that I love are Midnight in Harlem, Bound for Glory, Part of Me, All That I Need, and Walk Through This Life.

Before that, he played with the Derek Trucks Band (some of these guys are now part of TTB). Early in their career, they did a lot of jazz/world fusion. *Songlines* is probably the apex of this phase, and *Live at Georgia Theatre* has some very impressive guitar pyrotechnics. *Already Free* was their last album, and it's more blues- and soul-focused, looking ahead to a lot of the TTB material. It might be my second-favorite of his behind *Let Me Get By*. He was also a touring guitarist for the Allman Brothers from 1999-2014, so any Allman Brothers concert recording during that period is worth checking out.

He's best known for his slide work. He's strongly influenced by Indian music and incorporates a lot of microtonal stuff into his playing. His sense of phrasing and intonation is uncanny. But his non-slide playing is great too – check out the solos on ""For My Brother"" (Live at Georgia Theatre) or ""Part of Me."" His right-hand technique (all without a pick) is ludicrously good.

* Semi-hollow for blues/jazz. I'm thinking Larry Carlton, B.B. King etc. These guitars do have a greater potential for feedback at high volume, so may not be the best for super heavy styles. That being said, Dave Grohl has a semi-hollow signature guitar.

Surely you dont create an entirely new playlist every time you dj?? That makes no sense. 



Yeah by usher crushes every crowd that exists if played at the right moment. Theres no reason to take it off the playlist just because its wildly popular still. If you played yeah to the darkest techno crowd at *just the right moment* the place would go crazy. 


Yes, pop djing *is* about track selection, but i already know what they want, i can tell by looking at them, the timing is what makes a dj fucking amazing or just a jukebox. 



So one of my mini routines: i do some mid 90s bpm whatever(i like to do no scrubs to gold digger, one for the hoes and one for the bros) mix to ayy ladies(make sure you get everyone to chant the bad bitch holla part with a lowpass and get on the mic or motion to your ears for them to get loud) then i play get low, then i play bend ova, then i play turn down for what(all mixed so they double drop basically at 1st drop unless they love it and then i let it go longer, cutting the last song out at drop), then i play wop and then i play ciara 1,2 step and then if theres a bunch of girls i play promiscuous to sexyback to just dance to dynamite(you can get both songs to say dance at the same time before drop) so forth and so on. Thats like 7-10 minutes of djing. And im scratching minimally the whole time as well or maybe even juggling a bit if im feelin saucy. I also use my hi\low pass filter a lot as well as reverb. I make the bass hit harder by pulling it back a little before each drop. 


That shit isnt boring. Its pure bangers that bang so hard i gotta give people a break with something a little less bangin, and then i goto anaconda to baby got back(where the words match up) to bandz make her dance to no hands to what used to be r kelly ignition but i dont play that piece of shits music anymore. And then start back at around 140 wrap around to 70 and start back with really new top40 rap bangers then move upwards again with bpm.

A good idea becomes a tradition and a tradition becomes an institution — yep, we’re there by now when it comes to Tedeschi Trucks Band‘s fall residency at the storied Beacon Theatre in New York City, now in its ninth year. The sprawling band took the weight of its associative history — not least that The Allman Brothers Band made the Beacon their second home for decades — and made its own thing, consciously embracing, while also moving forward from, the musical ghosts of wild Beacon nights past.

The challenge for the TTB becomes how to sustain such momentum: as a band, as a touring outfit, as a tradition-bearer for a discerning New York crowd used to the kind of regularly eye-popping moments other music cities rarely get. A band this size evolves slowly, and it’s easy to let the comforts of tradition yield to predictability, as the Allmans occasionally did at the Beacon in leaner musical years — guests galore and covers aplenty to help spark excitement when the mojo wasn’t as easy to come by. There are guests and staple covers here, too — carpers might say too many, especially at the thinner shows of this 2019 run — but the TTB know how to construct a setlist to not overdo it.

What’s changed most about the TTB is the strength of the original music they write or record, which took time to meet the bar of how they play the music they cover. It’s maybe no coincidence that this shift coincided with years that, for the TTB, have been both triumphant and death-haunted — Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks, Col. Bruce Hampton, Leon Russell, Kofi Burbridge, Scott Boyer, Yonrico Scott and how many more. The material on Signs, their 2019 record, lands in the Venn diagram where hope meets defiance meets melancholy meets inevitability. This is passionate, knowing music — the band’s most mature statement to date as recording artists.


In the room for two tasty sets on the final night of the run, it was the recent TTB originals I felt drawn to most, especially “Hard Case” and “Shame” from Signs and barnburners like “Just As Strange” and “The Storm.” The potency of the Tedeschi Trucks Band as a live band was apparent right away when they first started up, but consistent original material took longer, give or take the great songs like “Midnight In Harlem” that stand out as “whoa” when surrounded by covers and/or decent excuses to sing and jam. The later tunes, however, stick, you feel how loaded they are, and then feel the emotional weight of the band compelled to create them. In contrast, when you hear the Tedeschi Trucks Band boogie and strut through its versions of “The Letter” or “Space Captain” or “I Want to Take You Higher” or any number of Layla tunes or any of their other go-to covers, you feel … happy, yeah, but also know they’re playing several levels away from the depth they can hit when song strength, band strength and jam strength are all locked in at once.

One way to think about it is that it’s frustrating; why does their setlist need so much window dressing, still? Another way to think about it is as needless worry. The Tedeschi Trucks Band is one of the most exciting live bands in the world, has been for some time now, and feels like one of the hallmark ensembles of the generation. They’ve set their own ridiculously high standards for what a punch-the-clock show is, and what a truly extraordinary show is. So much of what the paying public sees in live music in general is solidly, pleasantly “B,” so we’re asking how a consistent “A” becomes an “A+”? You want to stare down the mouth of that gift horse, friend?

Yes, because we know what an “A+” TTB show looks and sounds like, and Saturday’s Beacon run finale was in the ballpark, up to bat, even, but without rounding the bases. Two sets up, two sets down, and a mesmerizing panorama of moods, textures, genres, sounds and feels, thanks to a band in staggering command of its strengths. It was a great show. It was an adequate Tedeschi Trucks Band show.

Finding a coherent sound was always something that eluded the Derek Trucks Band — they were sonically adventurous and unbelievably interesting, but somehow stayed remote and uncharismatic. Tedeschi’s former band, in contrast, was accessible and warm-hearted, if a bit narrow and predictable. What the two principals do ever more here is balance those dominant tendencies; it’s too cute to call it a yin-and-yang, but it’s not inaccurate. And when there’s an entire, beamingly big band behind them willing to support that balance, well, that’s where the magic ignites.

The band is finding its way back. It doesn’t feel quite as integrated these days; how can it, with two new players in key roles in 2019? Bassist Brandon Boone and keyboardist Gabe Dixon, aces both in their own right, will take time and experience to help do what another version of the TTB was already starting to, which is enrich and draw more out of the music with asides, experiments, and interesting interactions among its ensemble players. No band with Tedeschi and Trucks in the title will ever put Tedeschi or Trucks in a supporting role, but what they were on to as recently as two years ago was a band that could meet even higher levels of its potential because they were just that friggin’ comfortable and locked in.

Saturday’s show had some really fun moments; the opening “Don’t Do It,” the romps and struts through “Sticks &amp; Stones,” “How Blue Can You Get,” “Part Of Me” and “Joyful Noise,” the tasty guest appearance from Joss Stone, perfectly paired with Tedeschi and the backing vocalists for the Four Tops’ immortal “Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever.” We got our Allmans jollies — and how fun to see old pal Ricky Gordon on washboard for “Statesboro Blues”! — and we got our Derek &amp; The Dominos jollies, and we got our Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen jollies. The superb vocalists — Mike Mattison, Mark Rivers and Alecia Chakour — were spicy, soulful and on point all night. The horns were popping, especially saxophonist Kebbi WIlliams, though Ephraim Owens and Elizabeth Lea were judiciously in the thick of it. Dixon picked his spots and delivered; Boone was a confident, no-bullshit anchor. And the drum corps of Tyler Greenwell and J.J. Johnson were put through the paces and met the challenge, especially in the all-killer back half of the second set, ending with “The Storm” and its mutation into “Whipping Post.”

When the Tedeschi Trucks Band went higher than jollies, however, we were not only delighted, but slayed. Perhaps not surprisingly, those moments put Tedeschi or Trucks in the center of the action. “Shame” and “Midnight in Harlem” came back to back in the first set, and Trucks destroyed each of them with two otherworldly, couldn’t-have-been-more-different, solos. Mid-way through the second set, the Allmans’ “Dreams,” which the band gamely started covering just this year, seized control of the night and demanded all of its energy keep pace as Trucks worked the classic tune’s anguish into a shattering climax. Tedeschi, who left everything on stage vocal-wise, stopped playing at one point in deference to how good it was. A song later, Trucks did the same thing, leaving Tedeschi to pull the room into her orbit and offer one of her best-ever versions of Bob Dylan’s “Don’t Think Twice (It’s Alright)” — butter-tender, achingly beautiful, so moving the audience sang in unison with every pronouncement of the title lyric.

A TTB show can hinge on those two things: Tedeschi’s charm and Trucks’ guitar sorcery. More words get used and abused on the latter subject than anything else related to the TTB, but man, it almost seems like too much will never be enough; when Trucks is deep in a solo, working out its angles, trying variations that even Trucks wonks who’ve heard him 1,000 times wouldn’t feel they’ve heard, building to a state that leaves the room in a trance, well, he stops time. All the energy in the show — no matter what’s come before it or will come after it, or who’s on stage, or what song it is — gets pulled into his gravitational pull, and his is the last word[Tedeschi Trucks Band Closes 2019 Beacon Residency: The Brutality Of All-Timer Expectations](https://www.jambase.com/article/tedeschi-trucks-band-beacon-residency-2019)",,2019-12-02 18:57:01,1575309421,,,{},f9h5jmn,True,t3_e4sgsy,False,True,t3_e4sgsy,/r/tedeschitrucksband/comments/e4sgsy/ttb_beacon_2019_the_brutality_of_alltimer/f9h5jmn/,1575309451,1,True,0.9995,[],False,tedeschitrucksband,t5_3c4ki,0.0,

Traffic on the road seemed unusually heavy, especially this far out in the boonies. Despite that, the diner was empty, aside from the old man who sat across from Derek and the waitress who topped off their coffee. The man took a drag on his cigarette and gazed off into the distance. 

For some reason, Derek couldn't recall how he'd gotten to the diner, but it didn't seem important, somehow. He took a moment to look across the booth at his companion. He had clearly seen more than a few winters; his beard was more salt than pepper and the wrinkles around his eyes were deep. And yet, there was a certain energy to him Derek couldn't quite make sense of. 

The man turned back and met Derek's eyes. He adjusted a suspender and brushed a few crumbs off his plaid shirt. He reached for his fork, pushing his cap further down the table to make room. 

""How's the hash, Derek?"" 

""Have we met before? How do you know my name?"" 

He chuckled, and ashed his cigarette with tobacco stained fingers.

""I've been traveling these roads a long time, son. Long time. What I know might surprise you."" He gestured at the rig parked outside before turning towards the counter. ""Hey Doris, I think my young friend here could use a top off."" 

""You got it darlin', coming right up."" 

She walked over with the coffee pot and winked at Derek as she filled his nearly empty mug. ""This'll help get you where you are going, right?""

""Thanks. Yeah, real lifesaver, for sure."" The old man and Doris exchanged a brief look, and she walked back behind the counter and began riffling through the receipts. The coffee was black as a moonless night and a little viscous, oddly enough. 

""Goes down smooth, don't it?""

""Yeah, sure does."" Derek felt tired. So tired. He thought about how much life had been running him down lately. One bad break after another.

""Tell me a little about yourself, Derek."" The man's voice was deep and rough around the edges. It reminded him just a little of his dad. Derek found himself talking at length about his adult life: the divorce, the booze, the robbery. Jail time. No home, no car, no job. Drifting from town to town, taking odd jobs when he could. Stealing when he couldn't.

The old man nodded along as Derek recounted his past. 

""I don't think -- I'm not a very good person."" 

The old man said nothing, and looked across the booth at him for what seemed like a long time. ""And what about recent events?"" 

Derek thought back to this morning. ""I was headed out of town. Pretty busy stretch of road. I saw a girl."" He paused for a moment. 

""Go on."" 

""She was just a kid, maybe 15, 16. I still remember her eyes. They were so sad. Sadder than any kid's eyes have a right to be. I knew right away what she was planning. Blind curve, trucks moving fast. I started running, just as she stepped out. I managed to push her out of the way -- I think. For some reason, it's a little fuzzy. And then I was, well, here. With you.""

They sat in silence for a moment. The old man smiled at him.

""Have some more coffee, Derek. Good for the spirit, I always say."" 

Derek took another sip. It really was good coffee. ""This is strange. What's going on? Is my luck finally beginning to change?"" 

""Well, son, I suppose that depends on your perspective. You've got some rest and peace coming your way. Why don't you come with me a spell?""

I 'think' in Open E now, and it gets easier every day with practice.

I'm guessing it would be a similar process for other tunings. For me it's been a it like learning a new instrument in some ways.

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

&gt; Robert Randolph &amp; The Family Band is a multicultural American blues and funk band composed of Robert Randolph, Marcus Randolph (drums), Danyel Morgan (bass), and Jason Crosby (organ). Frontman Robert Randolph was trained as a pedal steel guitarist in the House of God Church, Keith Dominion, in Nashville, TN and makes prominent use of the instrument in the band's music. The group's sound is inspired by successful 1970s funk bands such as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Sly &amp; the Family Stone, another multicultural band comprised of former members of the Church of God in Christ. Randolph himself has also stated that his main influence as a guitarist is Stevie Ray Vaughan.

&gt; Although he has only put out two albums, Rolling Stone magazine named Randolph as one of the 100 greatest guitar players of all time.

&gt; Robert Randolph set the music world on fire in late 2000 and early 2001 when he began to play his first club dates in New York City. These were a result of being discovered playing his pedal steel guitar at the first Sacred Steel Convention in Florida in the spring of 2000. Randolph started playing the pedal steel as a teenager and started playing at his Orange, NJ, church just outside of Newark. The House of God Church, an African-American Pentecostal denomination, has been implementing steel guitars (or ""Sacred Steel"") in services since the '30s, with the pedal steel in particular being introduced during the '70s. Randolph learned to play by watching other steel players in his church. Jim Markel was the man who heard Randolph play at the Sacred Steel Convention, and he later introduced him to his friend, Gary Waldman. Waldman, who already managed several artists, invited Randolph to audition for him. Waldman and Markel began to manage Randolph; they played the audition tape over the phone to Matt Hickey, talent buyer at Manhattan's Bowery Ballroom. Hickey signed Randolph on as the opening act for the North Mississippi Allstars and it was the beginning of a very large explosion. Within a month, Randolph was playing to thousands with Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood (MMW) at the Beacon Theater. Allstars and MMW keyboardist John Medeski liked Randolph so much that he asked him to record an all-instrumental gospel/blues album with them. The Word was released in August 2001 to great critical and popular acclaim. Randolph's own band, the Family Band, includes cousins Danyell Morgan and Marcus Randolph (bass and drums, respectively) and John Ginty (Hammond B-3 organ). Their career began with opening gigs for a variety of blues, jazz-funk, and jam bands such as the Derek Trucks Band, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe, and Soulive. Headlining gigs became the norm within a few months. Robert Randolph &amp; the Family Band released Live at the Wetlands in fall 2001. 2003's Unclassified and its single, ""I Need More Love,"" introduced Randolph to an even wider audience.

But that solo is not in my opinion ""epic"". It's disjointed and not much but electronic gimmickry. Another wasted opportunity to really have an impact on an amazing song. Imagine what a really great guitar solo would have done for that song!

Just my opinion. 

When I think of guitar solos, I'm thinking about people like John Petrucci, Randy Rhoads, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, guitarists who can really evoke powerful emotions using the guitar strings, not electronic gadgets.

What's really pathetic is that all of the less than good solos by Mr. Morello that I've heard are studio versions. I haven't really heard him solo live. But based on the studio versions of songs, where he has as much time and as many takes as he wants to get them the way he wants them, I'm not really interested in hearing him live.

&gt; Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. 

&gt; Remembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&amp;B, to rollicking good time rock &amp; roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.

&gt; Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.

&gt; By the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.

&gt; By 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.

&gt; Bishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.

&gt; As popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.

&gt; Delta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.

&gt; Elvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&amp;B, to a good dose of good-time rock &amp; roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”

328,[],,skydog72,,,,[],,,,text,t2_uxlr15w,False,,[],"I think it's a testament to the band as a whole that they were able to adapt to all of these bass players with completely different styles. In a lot of ways, Woody and Oteil come at the bass from totally opposite directions, but they both worked incredibly well in the Allman Brothers, and it seems like the band adapted to their style, not the other way around. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been fairly well documented that Woody really struggled in the band for the first few years. Warren said that Dickey, Gregg, and Butch each told Woody to play differently, and Woody was incredibly frustrated. Frankly, you can tell that he was struggling in some of those early shows in 89 and 90. Once he found his spot, he was amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Oteil is the longest tenured bass player in the history of the band, which is amazing. I love Oteil, but I've always thought that he and Derek had a major falling out in the last couple years of the ABB. He abruptly quit the Tedeschi Trucks Band, despite the fact that he was always trying to play with his brother Kofi. His official line was that he was quitting to focus on his family, but he quickly joined Dead and Company, which seems to be a similar gig in terms of time commitment. I also recently read an interview with Derek in which he said something like ""I've seen some guys recently joining bands that they've always said that they hated, which is weird."" To me, that's pretty clearly directed at Oteil joining Dead and Company. I can also see some evidence of some tension between them in videos of them playing together in the ABB after Oteil left TTB. They don't seem to interact like they used to. I wonder if anyone else has noticed that?

I know it’s gotten mixed reviews when compared to the KoT on here and other forums, so I made sure my hopes weren’t too high going in.

I’ve never played a KoT so I can’t give a comparison, but I gotta say, so far the PoT is sounding pretty damn fantastic with my setup (Les Paul, SG, and Tele into a ‘71 Super Reverb). It’s just a very balanced, natural sounding, dare I say “amp like” breakup that I can see working perfectly for tons of situations. It compresses a little, cuts a tiny bit of bass and boosts the mids/upper mids a little, but it isn’t peaky at all and feels much like the compression/EQ change that happens as you turn up a non-master-volume amp. I tried it through my Deluxe Reverb and compared it to the plugged-straight-in/cranked tone, and they were very similar. But not necessarily in the sense of it being an “amp in a box” pedal, it just augments the sound of your amp in a great way.

I’ve found that I like OD mode the most, and am currently using the pictured settings. Internal treble/presence pot is turned all the way down, and the dip switches are set to Dip 1 up, Dip 2 down. Boost mode sounds great too, tighter/less compressed, a little brighter, and a lot louder than OD mode. Dist mode isn’t really my thing, pushes the upper mids a little more than I like and is a lot more compressed, but I can see people liking it for a more aggressive sound. 

For reference, I mostly play blues, funk, r&amp;b/soul, late ‘60s/early ‘70s rock, a lot of slide influenced by Duane Allman/Derek Trucks, etc. The gig this Friday will be the real test, but there’s a good chance that this will become my primary “almost always on,” all-purpose overdrive.

334,[],,tugboattomp,,,,[],,,,text,t2_12pla6mt,False,,[],"[  Just one year ago, Schnatter fell from grace with the public amid comments made during a media training exercise where he reportedly used a racial slur and talked of his early life in Jeffersonville seeing African Americans dragged by trucks until their death.

Following those comments, his name came down from one place to the next, including the once Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium now just Cardinal Stadium. ...

In July of 2018, Jeffersonville Mayor Mike Moore returned money Schnatter donated to renovate the Nachand Fieldhouse, which included naming the facility after the former pizza giant. Schnatter’s name was also removed from Jeffersonville’s Wall of Champions, near the Big Four Bridge. ...

Now his name will adorn the JHS baseball facility for “the useful life of the baseball field,” according to the contract approved by the Greater Clark County Schools board Tuesday night in a 7-0 vote. ...

JHS Head Baseball Coach Derek Ellis, who was at the meeting with some of his baseball players, said he was “extremely excited” with the vote and approves naming the facility after the former JHS student-athlete.

“I’m very happy that it is [named after Schnatter],” Ellis said. “We have a former Jeffersonville High School baseball player and alumni who wants to help our young athletes and the facilities. If he’s willing to reach into his pocket and help us out in any way, shape or form, I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t have his name up on the scoreboard.”

Moore was disappointed with the vote.

“I guess everybody has to look in the mirror and do what they think is right. Obviously, we chose to go a different direction,” Moore said. “I’m proud that we did what we did. But the school board has to answer to the public and what comes along with every decision they make. That’s on them.”

Board members said they did seek feedback from the community.

“I specifically asked my constituents who are African American about this and the vast majority said a $500k donation, take it,” Board member Teresa Bottorff-Perkins said. “It’s what it is. I’m not going to deny the kids … from an updated baseball field because of a statement that [Schnatter] made.”

Board member Bill Hawkins said he analyzed Schnatter’s comments from that infamous phone conversation prior to accepting the donation.

“I read some of the transcripts of what went on during that meeting. My perception is that he was railroaded into saying some of those things and they were taken out of context,” Hawkins said. 

“I don’t think it was racist of what he said in the way that he said it and the fact that he was quoting someone else that was saying that phrase. He was specifically asked a question to draw that quote back out of him.” ...

The mayor said he wondered if the approval had to do with the size of the donation.

“I’m curious what the number would have been that the school board would have said no to,” Moore said.

Hawkins denied that being the case.

“No certain amount. That wasn’t a factor at all,” he said. “My perception was he fell out of grace with the powers that be, because he was stating his feelings about the athletes taking a knee during the anthem.” ...]

[Papa John's Founder Used N-Word On Conference Call - Nov. 7  2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/)

[  John Schnatter—the founder and public face of pizza chain Papa John’s—used the N-word on a conference call in May. Schnatter confirmed the incident in an emailed statement to Forbes on Wednesday. He resigned as chairman of Papa John’s on Wednesday evening. 

The call was arranged between Papa John’s executives and marketing agency Laundry Service. It was designed as a role-playing exercise for Schnatter in an effort to prevent future public-relations snafus. Schnatter caused an uproar in November 2017 when he waded into the debate over national anthem protests in the NFL and partly blamed the league for slowing sales at Papa John’s. 

On the May call, Schnatter was asked how he would distance himself from racist groups online. He responded by downplaying the significance of his NFL statement. “Colonel Sanders called blacks n—–s,” Schnatter said, before complaining that Sanders never faced public backlash.

Schnatter also reflected on his early life in Indiana, where, he said, people used to drag African-Americans from trucks until they died. He apparently intended for the remarks to convey his antipathy to racism, but multiple individuals on the call found them to be offensive, a source familiar with the matter said.

I’ll never forget how compelled I was by that solo. So much power, so much bravado - I desperately wanted to sound like him. Honestly, I don’t think this solo is particularly special in hindsight. But the fact that I was so taken with it is what drove me to learn it lick-for-lick. 

Technically speaking, it was the pentatonic scale that unlocked the most doors for me. By playing the D minor (Layla) pentatonic scale with my pointer finger anchored to the B and E strings, I could go up and down the scale playing most of Clapton’s licks around that anchor point. The key is picking up “the feel”. And in order to do that within the confines of “Layla”, I had to play it exactly like Clapton to the best of my ability. It’s really frigging hard especially if you most admire unique players. 

After lots of practice, I pretty much learned to play the solo like Clapton. Even then, I wasn’t ready to improvise on my own wits. I basically moved on to tons of different solos after that. John Mayer, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Derek Trucks, Joe Satriani, David Gilmour. I only cared about sounding like them and trying to play their solos.

All of this is to say you should try to sound like your influences.

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

&gt; Grace Potter &amp; the Nocturnals is an American rock band from Vermont. Formed in 2002 in Waitsfield by drummer Matt Burr, guitarist Scott Tournet, and singer Grace Potter, they began their career as an indie band, self-producing their albums and touring extensively in the jam bands and music festivals circuit, playing as many as 200 gigs in a year. In 2005 they signed for Hollywood Records and have subsequently released albums encompassing rock sub-genres such as blues rock, folk rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Their third, self-titled album (released in 2010) was a major commercial success, topping the iTunes charts and receiving international attention.

&gt; Grace Potter whose dynamic vocal ability has drawn comparisons to legends Bonnie Raitt, Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin and more recently Sheryl Crow and  Joan Osborne. Her unique style behind the Hammond B-3 and piano is also gaining widespread recognition. The original lineup included Scott Tournet (guitar/slide guitar), Matthew Burr (drums/percussion), and Bryan Dondero (upright/electric bass). After Dondero parted ways with the Nocturnals in March 2009, they brought in Catherine Popper (bass) and also added Benny Yurco (rhythm guitar).

&gt; They have toured with national acts such as Taj Mahal, Trey Anastasio, Dave Matthews Band, The Black Crowes, Derek Trucks, Gov't Mule and Robert Cray.  Read more on Last.fm.

The reason being is that the oil type itself is more expensive and there is more of it required. Then there is the also the diesel exhaust fluid that will need topped up or filled up.

&gt; Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. 

&gt; Remembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&amp;B, to rollicking good time rock &amp; roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.

&gt; Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.

&gt; By the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.

&gt; By 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.

&gt; Bishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.

&gt; As popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.

&gt; Delta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.

&gt; Elvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&amp;B, to a good dose of good-time rock &amp; roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”

SH: Shifting gears a bit, last year, Trey Anastasio sat in with TTB at the beacon. How did that come about, and what prompted choosing a mammoth tune like “Mountain Jam” for the occasion?

DT: He’s always been great to be around and just a super, super humble guy. I remember when he sat in with the Allman Brothers, it was a good hang. When we talked about having him come and sit in at the Beacon with us, I think we had the notion of doing “Mountain Jam” early on. I was just waiting to pick out the right time to do it. He seemed into the idea. Knowing his pedigree and what he does and knowing he had just gone through the Grateful Dead ringer and all that stuff, it felt like it’d be the right guy to step in and do it. I knew he’d give it a hard listen and give it the respect it deserved.

It was fun. We rehearsed maybe parts of it at sound check and just let it fly. That was a pretty special show and definitely that moment was great. We thought about breaking it back out again, but I feel like that’s one you got to pick and choose. Like we were talking earlier, you got to be ready for it and you got to mean it.

Phish was too academic and harsh and goofy, and in my opinion, they didnt have the heart or the soul that the Dead had. But when Trey accepted their invite, learned 100+ songs over a few months - not just casually but really learned them - just to play them a single time each .. totally blew me away that he was capable. And like someone just mentioned - he just did the same thing last weekend for Derek. If you havent seen it, you have to watch - it was amazing. I think Trey learned that whole Derek &amp; the Dominos album in a few weeks just so he could give Trucks a platform to showcase how good he is. And I think he did the same for the Dead.

I'll give you a few examples and you tell me if you honestly don't hear anything wrong.

What Susan's face here:
https://youtu.be/kcbb86Zv_kM?t=917

That is a look of concern for every note that is way off. That solo goes until 16:10 from where I cued it up, so watch it all and let me know if you don't hear anything wrong here. 

She is a pro, though, so she rolls with it and eventually just laughs at a lot of it because what else can you do in that situation? Everyone loves Bobby and they're not going to blame her for what he's doing.

At the beginning of this solo, she tries to give him a ""YEAH, YOU GOT IT"" nod after obviously being concerned at the first few notes...but then he immediately degenerates into off-key twiddling and the whole solo is just a giant mess and all she can do is laugh at the end of it:
https://youtu.be/kcbb86Zv_kM?t=1308

But, it's not just off-key soloing. His rhythm is completely out of tune through the whole thing. 

Here's 2 examples of that:

Watch him go out of tune here all over the beginning of this tune and then go over to ask her what he should be playing: https://youtu.be/kcbb86Zv_kM?t=749

In this song, he's regularly out of tune and Susan's head reflexively twitches when she hears it like, ""eh, not quite."" https://youtu.be/kcbb86Zv_kM?t=1710

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

&gt; Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. 

&gt; Remembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&amp;B, to rollicking good time rock &amp; roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.

&gt; Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.

&gt; By the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.

&gt; By 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.

&gt; Bishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.

&gt; As popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.

&gt; Delta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.

&gt; Elvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&amp;B, to a good dose of good-time rock &amp; roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”

Haven't gotten around to having it reconed yet.

I'm currently using four Eminence/Alessandro GA10-SC64 speakers, and I don't plan on changing them any time soon. They absolutely nail the vintage Blackface clean sound, and sound great overdriven too. They're made to sound like a broken-in vintage Jensen speaker, so you get the perfect amount of Fender sparkle without the harsh highs that modern Jensens can have. 

Other speakers I've tried:

Celestion G10 Greenback: liked them a lot, especially cranked up to overdrive. Very warm and full sounding and gave the amp a little Marshall flavor, but after a while the British-style mid hump started to get to me. They're great if you plan on playing more rock-oriented stuff, or if you want warm smokey cleans.

WGS Veteran 10: sounded great with single coils, not so great with humbuckers. With single coils they had a nice snappy Tweed-ish clean sound with a little bit of grittiness, but with my Les Paul they broke up very early and just had this ratty/nasty sound to them (in a bad way). 

Weber DT-10: they nail the early 2000s - early 2010s Derek Trucks tone when cranked up to overdrive, but that's about it. The breakup is fantastic, super tight and vocal, never harsh in the highs, but they're a little dull/flat if you're trying to get a good clean tone. Kind of a one trick pony. 

**TL;DR:** if you want *the* classic Super Reverb sound, I'd highly recommend the GA10-SC64's.",,2019-08-18 19:09:53,1566148193,,,{},excdj18,False,t3_bk9m0j,False,True,t1_exc3uee,/r/Guitar/comments/bk9m0j/discussion_fender_tweed_vs_brownface_vs_blackface/excdj18/,1566148195,1,True,0.9981,,False,Guitar,t5_2qi79,0.0,

A Hutchings le harán una autopsia el jueves para determinar la causa de la muerte, dijo Botti. De momento no se sabía cuántos tacos pudo haber comido el hombre ni si ganó el concurso.
La competencia de la noche del martes permite que los aficionados califiquen para el Campeonato Mundial de Comer Tacos del sábado, que se llevará a cabo en el festival anual de food trucks de Fresno, reportó la televisora KFSN-TV.
El vocero del equipo Fresno Grizzlies, Derek Franks, no respondió de momento los mensajes de The Associated Press. El equipo no hizo referencia al incidente en ninguna de sus redes sociales el miércoles, pero un anuncio para la competencia del sábado seguía publicado en su página de Facebook.

Kenny Wayne Shepherd - this dude has got Hendrix, Stevie Ray, and a wealth of other influences dialed in his style. I've never seen anyone play Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix the way this guy does. The last two records were really good (Lay it on Down, The Traveler), and so were the first two (Ledbetter Heights, Trouble Is...). If you learn how to play this guy's stuff, you'll simultaneously learn a bunch of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, and countless other guitar players. 

Brad Paisley - just go listen to Play: the Guitar Album. You may not like his other stuff, but this record is great. Keith Urban is a good player as well, when he's not trying to sing catchy songs. The lead player in the Brother's Osborne is also a really good modern country music guitar player, if you're into that style. I can't stand most modern country music, but those guys all have good songs playing wise. A good throwback is Jim Croce, though I don't honestly know who played on his songs.

Joe Walsh and Don Felder are both amazing. Hotel California speaks for itself. Felder played a fantastic guitar solo on One of These Nights. Both guys are tremendously talented.

Jonny Lang - his first two records are great. He came out around the same time as Kenny Wayne. 

Steely Dan - the records Can't Buy a Thrill, Aja, and Countdown to Ecstacy are all amazing, across all fronts.

Rob Caggiano - anthrax, Volbeat. This dude has played on the last three Volbeat records, and he's amazing. He can play anything, but does it in a really tasteful way.

Marty Friedman - Megadeth, others. This dude can play everything. He's just brilliant.

I'd mention Jimmy Page again, on the premise that he can play in a lot of different styles. Since I've been loving you, Thank you, rock and roll, ten years gone, Achilles last stand, the rain song, going to California, that's the way, bring it on home. They used to do a really great medley of cover songs during whole lotta love. He's not the most technical guitar player, nor does he have the most refined technique even in his day (George Benson, Al do Meola, Santana, and Alex Lifeson all come to mind and were active around the same time), but Jimmy incorporates a large breath of influences into his style that make him worth listening to.

Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin are both great blues players. Albert Collins is pretty spectacular as well. For acoustic blues, check out Keb Mo. For slide guitar, you can't go wrong with Sonny Landreth.

Derek Trucks and Samantha Fish are also good blues players. Trucks does more slide guitar. On that note, Duane Allman. 

More blues. This guy's less well known I think, but he plays with a lot of passion. Not the most technical player, but he's figured out a gigantic variety of blues spanning many decades: Tab Benoit. Go check out his cover of the song Bring it on Home to Me.

You can follow this list of players for literally years and still be digging deeper. My advice: don't pigeon hole yourself into a single style. Instead, soak up as much as you can while you're still learning, and dive deep into learning new things. You'll become a much better player for it. Also, try to start playing with others as soon as possible: learning to play with other musicians is a really important step if you want to improve, and you'll discover new influences that you'd never otherwise consider.",,2019-08-13 06:21:41,1565670101,,,{},ewqm0zd,False,t3_cpc4g3,False,True,t3_cpc4g3,/r/Guitar/comments/cpc4g3/newbie_what_artists_every_guitarist_should_know/ewqm0zd/,1565670102,1,True,0.9993,,False,Guitar,t5_2qi79,0.0,

&gt; Joe Bonamassa (born May 8, 1977) is an American blues rock guitarist, singer and songwriter.

&gt; Bonamassa was born in Utica, New York. He started playing guitar at age four, encouraged by his father, who was an avid music fan and exposed him to British blues rock records by Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, greatly inspiring him. At 11 years old Joe was mentored and trained by American guitar legend, Danny Gatton. When he was 12 years old, he had his own band called Smokin' Joe Bonamassa, which gigged around western New York and Pennsylvania, including cities such as Scranton and Buffalo, but only on weekends since Joe had school on weekdays. Bonamassa played a crimson 1972 Fender Stratocaster he called ""Rosie"", which his father had bought in Utica, New York.

&gt; When he was 12 years old, Bonamassa opened for B.B. King. In the last 13 years Bonamassa has put out 15 solo albums through his independent record label J&amp;R Adventures, of which 11 have reached number 1 on the Billboard Blues charts. Bonamassa has played alongside such artists as Stephen Stills, Eric Clapton, Blondie Chaplin, Foreigner, Buddy Guy, Steve Winwood, Warren Haynes, Solomon Hicks,and Derek Trucks among others.[4] His career highlights include performances at the Royal Albert Hall and a Grammy Award nomination in 2013. In addition to his music career, Joe Bonamassa runs a nonprofit organization called the Keeping the Blues Alive Foundation, whose mission is to further music education by funding scholarships and providing music education resources to schools in need.

&gt; He is also known for his enormous collection of guitars and related gear.  Read more on Last.fm.

He get's a lot of flak for being ""just another pop singer"", but he is more than that. He has a mastery of the guitar that has led people like Eric Clapton to proclaim that ""He's a master"". [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzfrXiD1_Rg).

He has been invited by Clapton and BB king to play with them on stage [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6dnI1WsFrA). He's played with Derek Trucks [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS0NHlWgi5w).

His work with the John Mayer Trio establishes him as one of the best blues guitarists out there, with a jaw dropping cover of Jimi Hendrix's ""Better wait till tomorrow"" [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-uSnRVy0Fs).

Aside from that, the man is a MASTER of creating a groove, and using the guitar to speak emotion. The guitar tone on 2006's ""Continuum"" is mind blowing. See the tracks [""Gravity""] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VBex8zbDRs) and [""Slow dancing in a Burning Room""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MkfBNl_3pw).

Not only this, but his entire style has evolved over the years. His initial offering on ""Room for Squares"" was acoustically driven, with bright poppy melodies and relatively few electric tracks.

This is in stark contrast to his later albums ""Battle Studies"" (tracks to look for [""Assassin""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP4cpVzw_Lc), [""Crossroads""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-a2IOKrQHY), ""Continuum"" (Tracks to look for [""Bold as Love""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQOWnHmBlbM), ""Born and Raised"" (Tracks to look for [""Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQOWnHmBlbM), and my new personal favorite album ""The Search for Everything"" (tracks to look for [Helpless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOdN6utMgQQ).

Each album offers something old (acoustic fingerstyle), new (country tracks, blues tracks, folk work), and something out there a bit (Conceptual songs).

The man is so much more than a pop singer/songwriter. He's not super flashy, he doesn't ""Shred"" in the typical sense of the word, but his ability to write, compose, produce, and PLAY the guitar is otherworldy.

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old.

653,[],,vilekangaree,,,,[],,,,text,t2_kdcv2wb,False,,,"HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Chinese military commander responsible for Hong Kong has assured a Pentagon official that Chinese troops will not interfere in the city’s affairs – an apparent signal that they will stay in their barracks amid renewed political upheaval. 

Trucks full of white-gloved People’s Liberation Army soldiers rolled into Hong Kong within hours of Britain handing its colony back to Chinese rule in 1997, sparking anxiety and raising lingering questions about their role.

Major General Chen Daoxiang was speaking at the start of a meeting last month with David Helvey, principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, according to people briefed on the discussion.

Helvey met Chen on a courtesy call at in the PLA’s Hong Kong headquarters on June 13 – just meters from where a day earlier police clashed violently with protesters seeking to prevent the passing of a now-suspended bill that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial.

Protests and violence have continued since, including some activists smashing their way into the legislature on July 1, daubing the debating chamber in graffiti.

“Major-General Chen made it clear from the outset that the PLA would not breach their long-standing principle of non-interference in Hong Kong affairs,” one source briefed on the discussions told Reuters.

“It was surprising, because he took it upon himself to raise it. It was a clear signal, coming at a sensitive time.”

A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Chen and a senior Pentagon official met. 

“Major-General Chen did mention that during a conversation last week,” the U.S. defense official said. “I can’t provide any more context to the conversation in that it was private, between the two leaders.”

A source with ties to the Chinese military said there were no plans for PLA involvement at the moment. 

“This is a Hong Kong matter for the Hong Kong government to resolve,” said the source, who meets regularly with senior officers.

The Chinese Defence Ministry and the PLA Hong Kong garrison did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.

The role of the PLA in Hong Kong has long been one of the most sensitive elements of the handover – and a presence closely watched by activists and foreign diplomats.

Some in the city fear the troops could be unleashed to quell violence but police chiefs have insisted their forces are capable of maintaining order.

Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule with a guarantee of its freedoms, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary not enjoyed on the mainland, for at least 50 years. Under its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, defense and foreign affairs are managed by Communist Party leaders in Beijing.

The Basic Law states that Hong Kong can request the garrison’s assistance to maintain public order but “they shall not interfere in local affairs”. They must abide by local laws, which are governed by the independent judiciary. 

VERY HIGH THRESHOLD

Chinese laws allow for the standing committee of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, to deploy the garrison if a state of war or emergency is declared for Hong Kong, citing “turmoil” that threatened national security that was “beyond the control of the (Hong Kong) government”.

Legal scholars say that is a very high threshold while some retired security officials say any involvement by PLA units in Hong Kong security would shatter the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong returned to China.

They would also expect police to secure any PLA facilities targeted by protesters.

Regina Ip, a member of the Hong Kong government’s leading advisory body and a former security chief, said despite “dangerous provocations” from some protesters, there was no appetite among Beijing or Hong Kong leaders for the PLA to become involved.

The bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on June 4, 1989, in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square had been a “millstone” on Chinese leaders for three decades and they remained sensitive to international criticism, she said. 

“I think the current leadership are smart enough to avoid this,” she said.

A second U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States noted the Chinese garrison’s low profile.

“If they got to the point where the PLA had to intervene in Hong Kong, it would be a significant admission that they’ve lost control.”

While acknowledging the likely reticence of Beijing deploying the PLA in Hong Kong, security analyst Derek Grossman of the U.S.-based RAND Corporation said there could be no guarantees if protests challenged the core interests of President Xi Jinping and his team.

“The Hong Kong garrison might seem like a symbolic presence, but the bottom line is that you can never really be sure they won’t be used, particularly if things start to move in a whole new direction, such as inspiring protest action on the mainland,” he said.Foreign envoys estimate the strength of the Hong Kong garrison at between 8,000 and 10,000, with troops in bases on both sides of the border. It includes a small naval and air force attachment.

While they stage frequent drills, they are seldom seen outside of their bases. 

The PLA still occupies bases formerly used by the British across the territory, including several prime sites on Hong Kong island and across the harbor in Kowloon.

The British-built PLA headquarters, topped by a large neon red and gold star, flanks key government offices and the city’s legislature – a key target of recent protests.",,2019-07-10 06:34:06,1562733246,,,{},etehtjv,True,t3_cbc14k,False,True,t3_cbc14k,/r/China/comments/cbc14k/exclusive_chinas_pla_signals_it_will_keep_hong/etehtjv/,1562733247,2,True,0.4488,,False,China,t5_2qh2v,0.0,1562833698.0

If the recording comes out and I hear again what I remembered hearing live at the show, I think it’s safe to say that it was one of their top shows ever. 

Sunday was my third show (Wheels of Soul ‘17, ‘18, and ‘19) and at times I honestly had trouble believing what I was seeing and hearing in front of me. Derek was just so indescribably perfect, it blows my mind. It’s like he is playing professional football while all the rest of the guitar greats (Mayer, bonamassa, etc.) are playing JV high school football. No one can come close at all to his level of skill. His phrasing, his intensity, the way he builds a solo from the ground up into realms you didn’t know were possible to reach on an instrument are sublime. He will hit a an incredible peak phrase in his solo and you’ll think “ah man, this solo is fantastic, how can someone be so good”, and then he’ll take it to an even *higher* peak that you could have never foreseen and it totally blows your mind. I wish I had the words to describe how Derek Trucks plays guitar, but I just can’t. I think it’s no secret that this man is almost certainly the best to ever touch a guitar (yes, even compared to the other guitar legends, past and present) and will be remembered as such. We will tell future generations of guitarists what it was like to see Derek Trucks play live.

The crowd was full of bikers camping out and obviously very thrilled about the completely free show and unexpected top level talent. Not very long into the show Jimmy introduced a very young man as “one of the youngest and best guitar players he’s ever heard”. I believe Derek Trucks was about 15 years old, slightly younger than I was at the time. He played most of the rest of the show and was absolutely fantastic.

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

Trying to recreate Stevie Ray or Derek Trucks' sound is foolish.

  
Don't worry about your gear, learn how to play.  


Flame tops are garish, gold plating is gross  


Guys who wipe their guitars off after playing/guys who don't wipe their guitars off after playing  


From the comments:  

You mean like playing really loud, not caring about changes in texture and dynamics, filling the entire sonic spectrum and playing over everyone else's parts so there's no point in having any other instruments
 

Guys (why guys?) who noodle between songs at practice while the band is trying to discuss something  


People who try to talk while you're noodling at practice  


Not knowing how to roll up cables (circular style, I assume) ruins them  


Guitarists that can't play rhythm, give no room for anyone else, flood of notes won't stop soloing  


 Ending every run on the root -  don't be *that* guy. 

Guitar players who ask to play your guitar, and then spend the next 20 minutes talking about how much they hate it.

Noodling during songs

As a bass player my 2 major pet peeves are:

Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

676,[],,djsjjd,,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fq30,False,,,"Thanks for the tips. I respectfully disagree and here's why: I'm aware of the late 80s run that many deadheads refer to. That, of course, is a reference to their live playing and my comment was primarily from a writing perspective and the dead was not writing many good songs after the 70s. I'd also argue that the run you cited is primarily because of popularity of touch of grey which injected new life into the scene and created a lot of new younger deadheads and I think that the bulk of the people who like that era are touch-of-grayers who remember not the music so much, but more the experience.
 
My main problem with 1980s Dead is that Brent Mydland ruins the music for me. I know a lot of people like him and were happy to see Donna Jean go and I'm not a huge fan of hers either, but I can't understand Brent. First is the electronic piano sound that he used incessantly. It sounds like the Casio keyboard version of an old child's jack in the box crank music player. (Remember the old metal ones?) I don't know why the band let him stick with that. It is horrid - just about any other sound would be better and it detracts from every song it is in which is just about every song he plays on. Does anyone know a story behind that keyboard sound? Second, is his voice. Every time he opens his mouth he uses that straining gravely falsetto that sounds like he has been constipated for two weeks and is trying to push through with the most painful shit imaginable.  It's hard to bring a new member into that band that wouldn't improve the vocals, but somehow they managed to make them worse with Brent. I know he became Jerry's smack bud, but I don't understand what they saw in him at the start. To be fair, I think he was a very good piano player and I would have liked him much more had he not used the electro trash effect and not sang every verse like he was in the middle of hara-kiri

I appreciate the suggestions for the other bands, but I'm familiar with them all. In fact I was a regular listener of Jam On on Sirius radio and I wish they found room for both the phish station and jam on and I'm sad to see it disappear. I don't really get into the bluegrass stuff too much. I love Derek Trucks, though, and watch him live any chance I get. I think he's one of the greatest guitar players alive and probably the best slide player ever at this point. I can't think of another guitarist who can shut John Mayer up on stage.  He can pull sounds out of the guitar that I've never heard before, especially lower notes with the slide. Unfortunately, I don't like his wife enough to listen to entire albums and I wish she would step back and only do a couple of songs per set/album, so that he is not stuck in her limited jazz style.",,2019-07-02 20:59:19,1562093959,,,{},eslx7y0,False,t3_c87ywp,False,True,t1_eslbj5l,/r/phish/comments/c87ywp/phish_chick_loses_her_shit_to_providence_bowie/eslx7y0/,1562093966,4,True,0.8184,,False,phish,t5_2ql29,0.0,1562370290.0

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

Seen a lot of 60’s and 70’s musicians play in Woodstock, NY club in the 70’s and early 80’s. One evening, Bob Dylan walked into a club at 11:30pm and started jamming. 

My oldest daughter’s favorite band is The Allman Brothers. We went to many of an Allman Brothers Band  and Greg Allman Band New Year’s Eve concerts up until the time he could no longer tour. We have gone to hear Dickey Betts in clubs. 

We went to Derek Trucks (nephew of Butch Trucks - Greg Allman’s drummer) Band concerts.  Have heard Derek Trucks join the Greg Allman Band on stage. The kids and used to picnic next to Dwane Allman’s grave (probably sounds weird, I know. We used to walk grave yards and read gravestones when my kids were growing up.  They still dig going to graveyards as adults. Lol). 

And now that Derek is married to Susan Tedeschi, we go to the Tedeschi Trucks Band concerts. My brother used to be in a band with Susan before she made it big. Would go hear them play in Boston clubs.

&gt; The Derek Trucks Band is a band started by slide guitarist prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with The Allman Brothers Band, as early as eleven years old. Raised partly on tour with them throughout his youth, meeting and playing with famous musicians, Trucks was still unsure about his own future. He resolved to start his own band while still an adolescent. What first began as a side project, and a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity, has evolved into an eclectic band with some of the most talented musicians from the southeastern United States. Loosely based in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida since 1994-1995, since his mid-teens, the band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and tastes of its current band members, and has gained fame for playing blues, southern rock, jazz, Indian classical, and a fusion of world music.

&gt; Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Derek Trucks took up the guitar at age 9, and it was quickly apparent that he was a child prodigy. He was playing with a band and touring within two years. His early repertoire was heavily blues-based, obviously inspired by The Allman Brothers Band, of which his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, is a founding member. Older bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf, jazz musicians Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Christian and later Wayne Shorter and many others, became an influence for Trucks a few years later. Eastern Music, mainly Indian Classical, also affected Trucks's musical development, primarily his slide guitar playing, which is often compared to that of Duane Allman but is also heavily influenced by sarod players like Ali Akbar Khan. In 2003, he was the youngest guitarist on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time, and has been hailed as one of the greatest slide guitarists since Duane Allman.

&gt; Trucks formed his first band at age 12, and played his first gigs with them as ""Derek and the Dominators"". Later, Atlanta's jazz and blues bassist Todd Smallie joined Trucks in 1994, and became the first member of what is now the current version of The Derek Trucks Band. When Trucks really set about assembling a lasting band, he was by his reckoning about 14 years old. Smallie, on bass, was the first to join him. As a result, Trucks feels that he's ""kind of grown up with him."" A year later in 1995, drummer Yonrico Scott completed the band's early rhythm section. The band released its self-titled debut album, The Derek Trucks Band, in 1997, and followed with Out of the Madness in 1999. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 16 years as of 2008. According to Derek Trucks: ""We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.""

&gt; Kofi Burbridge joined the band shortly thereafter, contributing to the band's sound as a multi-instrumentalist, with his versatility on keyboards, flute, and vocals. Like his brother, whom Trucks plays with in the Allman Brothers Band, bassist Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge's education was primarily rooted in classical and jazz music. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks laughingly commented, ""Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with, he's totally insane""... continuing, ""I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.""

&gt; In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, ""He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike."" Mattison had a previous band as well-- a vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with Paul Olsen, a guitarist and vocalist, whom he still performs with at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band. The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of African drums. Trucks mentions casually that he had known M'Butu for many years before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases.

&gt; Trucks' guitar playing is unusual in a number of respects. He steadfastly avoids processing and effects, preferring to get the purest tone possible by connecting his guitar directly to his amplifier, a 1964 Fender Super Reverb. He modifies his tone with the controls on the guitar. He plays without the use of a plectrum (pick), using his fingers instead, plucking primarily with the thumb, index and middle fingers, but also using the ring finger on occasion. He developed his technique himself. His guitar is always tuned to 'Open E'. From the low to high string, (i.e., EBEG#Be) he slightly detunes his low E string (a technique he and Jimmy Herring developed while playing together). Open E is a normal tuning for slide players, as it allows them to form chords more easily, but over the years he has become a highly acclaimed straight lead player without switching to standard tuning (EADGBe).

&gt; In 2001, Trucks married singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. The couple have two children: Charles Kahlil Trucks (born March 8, 2002), and Sophia Naima Trucks (born August 9, 2004). Charles is named for saxophonist Charlie Parker and guitarist Charlie Christian; his middle name is taken from author Khalil Gibran. The name Sophia has mystic overtones (meaning ""Wisdom"" in Greek), and the unusual middle name comes from the John Coltrane ballad, which Coltrane named after his first wife, Naima.

&gt; In 1999, Derek Trucks joined his uncle, drummer Butch Trucks, as a member of The Allman Brothers Band, while continuing to lead his own band. With the Allman Brothers Band he has performed on 2000's Peakin' at the Beacon, 2003's Hittin' the Note, 2003's live DVD At the Beacon Theatre, and 2004's One Way Out.

&gt; As of early 2006, Trucks is an accompanying guitarist in Eric Clapton's 2006-2007 touring band. In early 2006, Trucks lost equipment, as an equipment trailer was stolen. Some of the gear was recovered on May 18, 2006, as reported in the Columbia Records Derek Trucks Forum. Gear that was reported as recovered from a field outside Atlanta, GA includes Derek's ""1965 BFSR, the amp he's been playing since he was a young boy; Derek's 1968 SFSR (one of the backup amps),the DTB's Hammond B-3, two Leslies, a Hohner E-7 Clavinet, and a few other minor items.""

Duane Allman was one of the best slide players to ever live, and Warren Haynes (later addition) is an amazing player as well. Particularly listen to their Live at Fillmore East album - [(Spotify Link)](https://open.spotify.com/album/4XF6xf8JKT2i24LJGVqqyj?si=ORKYv-r-RQOPa1zpSCNjMA). Statesboro Blues is one of the best slide songs recorded, but the first five songs off  that album are a clinic in slide guitar. 

&gt;Tips/Tricks

I play slide with my fingers. I use my thumb, index, and middle almost exclusively, and I keep the slide on my ring finger of my left hand. Make sure when you play a note, the slide is positioned directly over the fret - the metal fret, not the spot on the fretboard you would put your finger! That means every note is going to be a little farther down the neck than you’re used to. 

Keep a finger down behind the slide, and practice playing only a single note at a time. This requires some excellent muting with both your left and your right hand - but if it’s done right then the idea is to almost mimic a vocal line with the slide, and vocalists can’t sing chords (usually). 

I tend to use the slide to do a sort of call and response thing with the singer - that’s mostly how Duane did it so that’s what I picked up. Singer sings a line, you throw in a lick that either contrasts or builds upon the melody from the vocals. 

&gt;Tuning

I play slide in a bunch of open tunings - I’ve done it in Standard, but usually open. Open E is my usual, but I sometimes do open G. 

Important things to know about open tunings: Open D and Open E are the same, open G and Open A are the same. Now obviously they’re not the same notes, but they have the same intervals - which means that if you tune your guitar to open D, a capo at the second fret puts you in open E. If you’re in open G, a capo at the second fret puts you in open A. 

In any of your open tunings, you have a nice little box at the 10th-12th fret - it’s literally a rectangle, and any of the strings played at either the 10th or 12th fret will be in key. If you’re in open E, that same box exists for D at 8/10, and if you’re in open A, G is at 8/10. If you listen to Statesboro Blues, Duane’s guitar is in open E, but the song is in D. Like 90% of the playing he does is done in that little box at the 8th and 10th fret - it’s a great easy place to start with slide. 

&gt;Type of Slide

I use glass bottleneck slides that I get from [Diamond Bottlenecks](www.Diamondbottlenecks.com). I spent $81 and got the Ultimate slide, the Redhouse, and the Blue Diamond. They all fit me perfectly (they had me measure my fingers with a ring sizer), and they sound a hundred times better than the crappy Dunlop slides I was using before. They also sound distinct from each other - the blue diamond and redhouse are similar with small differences, and the ultimate sounds a ton different - much smoother and less bright than the other two (of which the blue diamond is the brightest). I have a few brass slides but I don’t use them as much. I use knuckle slides so I can bend my ring finger, as opposed to the whole finger slides that some people use. 

&gt;Songs?

Statesboro Blues was my first foray into slide. That, Done Somebody Wrong, and Trouble No More are all great songs. Sky Is Cryin’ by Elmore James is also a good slide song to learn. If you want something quite a bit more difficult, Uberesso by Sonny Landreth is crazy. Gov’t Mule also has a few songs where Warren Haynes plays slide - I believe their version of Catfish Blues is slide. 

&gt;Favorite Players?

Duane Allman, Derek Trucks, Sonny Landreth, Warren Haynes, Elmore James. There’s a bunch of other solid slide players but those five are enough to make you an incredible slide player. 

And one final fun fact: B.B. King developed his signature wide vibrato because he could never play slide, and he was jealous of his cousin who played slide. So he did his best to approximate the vibrato you can get with a slide, with just his fingers.",,2019-06-20 21:17:27,1561058247,,,{},ernpq88,False,t3_c2vsm0,False,True,t3_c2vsm0,/r/Guitar/comments/c2vsm0/question_i_just_bought_my_first_slide_what_are/ernpq88/,1561058248,2,True,0.9986,,False,Guitar,t5_2qi79,0.0,1561144645.0

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

Description: Derek born in Australia right before the war started, His mother went to the military to help with the war when Derek was 7. His mother died while protecting the people in her medical camp which took a toll on Derek, his brothers, and his father. Derek became suicidal, but one day, something weird happened. He was talking to his best friend at school, when he heard something from behind him, it sounded like a fence rattling. He turned around and saw a thing. It was fully gray, with a humanoid seeming body. The thing had three empty eye sockets and a painfully wide grin across its face. It had crooked and disgustingly yellow teeth, which were covered in blood. The thing had long arms, touching the ground and dragging behind it self. It had long, greasy, and matted black hair, it touching the ground with its length. It stood up and was about 14 feet tall, it grabbed hold of the fence and disjointed its legs to climb over the fence, it had been maintaining eye contact for this entire time. It got on its hands and legs and disjointed its mouth, literally making it swing around. Derek’s friend looked over and screamed. Right when he screamed the beast started running and jumped the fence, than grabbed his friend in his mouth and tore his body apart. The beast smiled wider at Derek and ran away. He stood there with his friends body at his side for about twenty minutes. He went home and could never fall asleep. Two days later he walked into his bedroom and felt something off. He sat on his bed and stared at the window. Everything was quiet, and then he heard it. Breathing. He got off of his bed as quickly as he got and ran to the door of his room. It was locked. He watched in horror as the creature started bending and breaking its bones to fit out of the bed, than scrawled out. He stood up and started slowly walking towards Derek. Derek started banging on his door and then the creature grabbed his hand. The creature melt down to Derek’s eye level and spoke. It’s breath smelled of rancid meat and spoiled milk “*im sorry Derek, I didn’t mean to scare you*” it smiled, and broke the window than jumped out. This is when Derek stopped talking, driving his father mad. His father became an alcoholic, spending every last penny on drinks. He constantly beat Derek and Harry and eventually, when they were both 15, they started planning and took their dad to a lake for “fishing” They put a chloroform rag on their father and took him to a small boat shed. They pulled out a machete and decapitated their father, than let the fish eat him. When Derek and Harry got home their brother, Jonathan, beat them both. Harry became worried about getting arrested and told Derek about going to the police about the murder. Derek grabbed his fathers handgun and put it in his car, he then took Johnathan on a hike to an abandoned cabin, then Derek shot him in the back of the head. He went back home and shot Harry three times in the chest. Then he left, and moved to America, switching schools. He got straight A’s in every class and was in three extra curricular activities. This was all while getting teams and robbing banks, jewelry stores, and gun stores. When he graduated he went to college and became a weapons engineer. He eventually took a vacation to Africa and got his signature revolver, this is where he was arrested. He got the name Spooky after sharing his story. He became a leader of one of the gangs in there and eventually stopped talking to he rest of his gang. He had seen the creature again. It was outside of his prison window, crawling across the ground. It disappeared and crawled up the wall, making its prescience known to Derek. Those other nights he kept feeling something moving it’s finger across the bottom of his bed. At night he woke up the feeling of the hair on his face. The beast was right in front of him, breathing it’s disgusting breath. Derek took the concrete shank out of his pillow and stabbed the creature in the throat. In the morning the guard came by and saw Derek covered in the creatures black blood, and the beast on the floor. Derek was transferred to Rikers prison and made a gang there. At night he was able to make C4 and destroy the walls to his and his gangs cells. They all escaped and became a criminal group. Their first target was Fort Knox. They robbed that place and took weapons. They made a big attack right before the bombs went off. He was 29 by now and created a name for himself, The Talon. He killed lots of people and went to an area in Chicago. He went with his gang to Sears tower where they pulled in bomb trucks, they blew up the tower and made it collapse, but at that moment there were bomb sirens. He went to the basement of the tower and locked himself in there, where he survived off of other people. He got out and was introduced to here, where he got a new trench coat and a mask, made out of human flesh. He had stitched it to make a large painful grin and have no eyes. He permanently attached it to their head using stitches and got into lots of battles, losing his arm and leg, but making metal replacements with a skin filter. He made his way to new denvis where he became the general of the military.

At 11 years old Joe was mentored and trained by American guitar legend, Danny Gatton. When he was 12 years old, he had his own band called Smokin' Joe Bonamassa, which gigged around western New York and Pennsylvania, including cities such as Scranton and Buffalo, but only on weekends since Joe had school on weekdays. Bonamassa played a crimson 1972 Fender Stratocaster he called ""Rosie"", which his father had bought in Utica, New York.

&gt; When he was 12 years old, Bonamassa opened for B.B. King. In the last 13 years Bonamassa has put out 15 solo albums through his independent record label J&amp;R Adventures, of which 11 have reached number 1 on the Billboard Blues charts. Bonamassa has played alongside such artists as Stephen Stills, Eric Clapton, Blondie Chaplin, Foreigner, Buddy Guy, Steve Winwood, Warren Haynes, Solomon Hicks,and Derek Trucks among others.[4] His career highlights include performances at the Royal Albert Hall and a Grammy Award nomination in 2013. In addition to his music career, Joe Bonamassa runs a nonprofit organization called the Keeping the Blues Alive Foundation, whose mission is to further music education by funding scholarships and providing music education resources to schools in need.

&gt; He is also known for his enormous collection of guitars and related gear.  Read more on Last.fm.

725,[],,Z7271227,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4rqcq,False,,,"The main goal when setting up a guitar for slide would be to avoid having the slide make contact with the frets while playing. There are a few adjustments you can do to improve a strat for slide. 

* raise the string height at the bridge saddles
* raise the string height by raising the bridge angle (loosening the springs)
* use higher gauge strings to provide more tension (you will have to adjust the springs to compensate)
* install a taller nut (this is more of a modification than a setup, only do this if you don't want to play with your fingers anymore)

I am not sure how the truss rod would be adjusted for slide, but I would recommend not messing with that.

Some players have their strings low enough to hear the slide hit the frets sometimes (Derek Trucks). This is usually when they play the same guitar with their fingers and with a slide. It is a trade-off between having the action low for your fingers and having it high for the slide.

Glass slides and metal slides have different sounds, but aside from that it is mostly just preference. There are lots of options for shape like open/closed top, thickness, length, width.

Some realtors rank Five Points’ desirability among young homebuyers on par with Elmwood and Hertel’s.

But the pace of recent development raises questions about the uncertain line between revitalization and gentrification, both delicate topics in a region starved for urban growth. And residents see both promise and peril in the new neighbors sipping pour-overs and dropping $250,000 on two-bedroom bungalows.

Some say they’ve already seen renters pushed out so houses could be flipped. Others gripe about the new cars parking on their streets, the noise from restaurant patios, and the tax bills they expect to see next year when the city completes property tax reassessments.

In many ways, the tensions unfurling in Five Points aren’t just the complexities of one neighborhood – they’re also the embodiment of far larger questions about who gets a place in the city’s revitalization, particularly as it accelerates beyond what early advocates imagined.

""Losing the diversity, losing the affordability – those are problems,” said Harvey Garrett, a neighborhood activist who led successful efforts to cut crime and vacancy rates in the early 2000s. “I helped create the mess. But I'm not sure how to address it now.""

*[The Five Points neighborhood on the West Side of Buffalo, where Rhode Island Street intersects with West Utica Street, Wednesday, May 22, 2019. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1012963654-Five-Points-ae2.jpg-930x581.jpg)*

Up the street from Remedy House, at the corner of 19th and Rhode Island, Joan Murray surveys the timber skeleton of what will soon be her new one-story house, with an attached garage and full basement.

There was a time when vacant lots on this street – “one of the worst crime streets on the West Side,” said Garrett – were left to grow weedy and fallow; some sold at city auction, often to nonprofit housing groups, for as little as $500.

But those days are fast receding. This short block echoes, on sunny days, with the hum of lawn mowers and power drills and garbage trucks hauling construction debris. Contractors have almost finished flipping 23, and 49 rents for hotel-room rates to tourists on Airbnb.

Across the street from Murray’s lot, Lycra-clad yogis squat and lunge through 90-minute classes in what was, until 2016, a collapsing warehouse. Sweaty students stream out after class on weekend mornings, off to brunch at Providence Social or $12 toast at Five Points Bakery or bottles of rosé at the natural wine shop.

“Everybody wants a piece of the action now,” said J-M Reed, a local realtor involved in early efforts to revive the neighborhood’s real estate market. “Everywhere you go,” he said, “there's somebody doing something here.”

Neighborhood activists and block clubs could only dream of change like this when they began their work in the '90s and early 2000s. Like much of Buffalo’s West Side, the neighborhoods west of Richmond Avenue – once the heart of the city’s Italian working class – suffered decades of postwar disinvestment at the hands of federal regulators, who restricted access to home loans on the basis of “old buildings and overcrowding” and the area’s “large foreign population.”

Later, in the 1970s and ‘80s, many residents moved to newer housing in the suburbs. As demand fell, home prices bottomed out – attracting a diverse community of low-income immigrants and other city residents who made the area one of the city's rare, racially integrated neighborhoods. But low prices also drew squatters and drug dealers. On 18th Street, crime grew so severe that residents paid an off-duty cop to patrol their block after dark for $15 an hour.

""The neighborhood back [then] was very seedy,” said James “Macky” Moberly, the owner of Essex Street Pub, who grew up just across the street on Lexington. “If our dog ran away and it ran down this way, we didn't cross Richmond.""

But from his patio at Essex and Rhode Island – crowded once with “bohemians” and artists, and now increasingly with Elmwood residents and college students – Moberly has enjoyed a good view of the neighborhood’s transformation.

Groups like Garrett’s West Side Community Collaborative began targeting this area in the early 2000s, betting they could revive housing demand on the streets nearest Elmwood once the dealers and overgrown lots were gone. Residents planted gardens and boarded up broken windows. The community group PUSH Buffalo rehabbed rundown buildings into affordable apartments. Garrett lobbied for changes in city housing policy that toughened penalties for bad landlords – then led skeptical realtors on tours past boarded cottages and bowed-porch doubles.

By the time the Urban Roots garden co-op opened at Five Points in 2007, and even more so when Five Points Bakery opened two years after that, home prices in the near West Side had skyrocketed – quadrupling between 2000 and 2010, according to a West Side Community Collaborative analysis. Prices have jumped yet higher since then as Five Points gained a reputation as a ""hot"" neighborhood, independent of its original boosters and activists.

""This, more than any other neighborhood in the city, was picked up by grassroots efforts,” said Chris Van Veghten, who bought her neat Victorian on Vermont and Brayton in 1984. That echoes the findings of a recent paper in the Fordham Urban Law Journal on the rebirth of Essex: ""If decline is a tragedy of the commons,” the paper concludes, “it is potentially avertible by neighborhood collective action.”

Today, the Five Points neighborhood remains “a little rough around the edges,” to borrow a phrase many residents use. But the intersection is also the beating heart of a growing commercial district, populated by young creatives like Phylicia Dove, the 31-year-old fashion designer who won $50,000 from Facebook and 43North after teaching herself to sew on YouTube, and Victor Parra Gonzalez, the Mexican chef whose offbeat cooking has earned multiple James Beard Award nominations.

Later this month, they’ll be joined by Blue Table Chocolates and Petrichor Flora, both businesses founded by small entrepreneurs who relocated to Buffalo. Kevin Gardner, the owner of Five Points Bakery, unveiled plans in May to open an artisan market on the corner.

The gas station bodega across the street also upped its game, opening a hot food counter that sells sandwiches and subs.

""The neighborhood changed,” said Masen Ali, flipping chopped steak on the grill. “We had to change with it.”

But just across the street, near the intersection of West Utica and Shields, change has looked different to Mikal Jackson, a 28-year-old construction worker. The neighborhood “looks nicer,” Jackson said, but many of the families he grew up with, some of them good friends, moved out when landlords sold their houses or jacked up their rents. The new neighbors are wealthier and keep to themselves; many moved to the West Side from places like Williamsville or Lockport, he said.

Most longtime residents can today name two or three flipped buildings where refugees, Section 8 tenants, or other low-income renters used to live: On Vermont, neighbors say, a sooty white double that sold for $1,000 eight years ago now rents for more than $1,000 per month per unit. Around the corner at Rhode Island and 15th, a four-story brick building once called “the squatter hotel” has been converted to the luxury Lofts at Five Points – complete with sliding barn doors and stainless steel appliances. The building sat quiet on a recent Thursday afternoon, save for the lone woman heaving a can-loaded shopping cart past to the 14th Street redemption center. 

“Some people in the area are already getting priced out of buying non-distressed houses,” Garrett warned in an email to other activists in 2011. “And we are starting to see some shocking rental prices.”

According to Zillow, the median monthly rent in Five Points is now $900 – on par with the city overall, but up 20% from 2011.",,2019-06-14 16:01:02,1560520862,,,{},er592a2,False,t3_c0iya4,False,True,t1_er545xn,/r/Buffalo/comments/c0iya4/five_points_in_one_west_side_neighborhoods/er592a2/,1560520872,8,True,0.545,,False,Buffalo,t5_2qi6i,0.0,1560806165.0

&gt; Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. 

&gt; Remembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&amp;B, to rollicking good time rock &amp; roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.

&gt; Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.

&gt; By the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.

&gt; By 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.

&gt; Bishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.

&gt; As popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.

&gt; Delta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.

&gt; Elvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&amp;B, to a good dose of good-time rock &amp; roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

&gt; Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. 

&gt; Remembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&amp;B, to rollicking good time rock &amp; roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.

&gt; Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.

&gt; By the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.

&gt; By 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.

&gt; Bishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.

&gt; As popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.

&gt; Delta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.

&gt; Elvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&amp;B, to a good dose of good-time rock &amp; roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”

&gt; Hard-rocking blues-soaked guitarist/vocalist/song-writer Tinsley Ellis sings and plays with the energy and soul of all the great Southern musicians who have come before him. Ellis attacks his music with rock power and blues feeling, following in the tradition of Deep South musical heroes Duane Allman, Freddie King, Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes. His live shows feature extended fretwork filled with melodic and rhythmic experimentation, in the spirit of jam bands like his friends Widespread Panic and The Allman Brothers. Atlanta Magazine declared Ellis ""the most significant blues artist to emerge from Atlanta since Blind Willie McTell."" 
Since first hitting the national scene with his Alligator Records debut, GEORGIA BLUE, in 1988, Ellis has toured non-stop and continued to release one critically acclaimed album after another. His stellar guitar work, always a staple of his live shows and CDs, is matched by his strong songwriting and powerful, soulful vocals. Tinsley's hometown paper, The Atlanta Journal Constitution, calls his music, ""a potent, amazing trip through electric blues-rock.""

&gt; Ellis made five critically acclaimed albums for Alligator between 1988 and 1997 before recording for the Capricorn and Telarc labels. His high-energy LIVE-HIGHWAYMAN, the long-awaited live album his fans have been demanding for years, marked his return to Alligator records. ""Tinsley is one of the finest younger generation blues rockers. He's made great albums for us in the past, and we're excited to have him back in the Alligator family. He's great in the studio, but even better live, so I'm really excited about this recording,"" said Iglauer.

&gt; Ellis' latest release on Alligator, MOMENT OF TRUTH, captures all the power and energy of his legendary live performances. His vocals reach new heights of soulfulness and expressiveness; his guitar playing is ferocious and relentless, but, when the mood calls for it, gentle and moving. What really sets the album apart, though, is the depth of Ellis’ songwriting. The material deals in matters both personal and universal and runs the gamut of human emotions. MOMENT OF TRUTH is Ellis’ most wide-ranging and inspired recording. 

&gt; Born in Atlanta in 1957, Ellis grew up in southern Florida and first played guitar at age eight. He found the blues through the backdoor of the British Invasion bands like The Yardbirds, The Animals, Cream, and The Rolling Stones. He especially loved the Kings--Freddie, B.B. and Albert--and spent hours immersing himself in their music. His love for the blues solidified when he was 14. At a B.B. King performance, Tinsley sat mesmerized in the front row. When B.B. broke a string on Lucille, he changed it without missing a beat, and handed the broken string to Ellis. After the show, B.B. came out and talked with fans, further impressing Tinsley with his warmth and down-to-earth attitude. By now Tinsley's fate was sealed; he had to become a blues guitarist. And yes, he still has that string.

&gt; Already an accomplished teenaged musician, Ellis left Florida and returned to Atlanta in 1975. He soon joined the Alley Cats, a gritty blues band that included Preston Hubbard (of Fabulous Thunderbirds fame). In 1981, along with veteran blues singer and harpist Chicago Bob Nelson, Tinsley formed The Heartfixers, a group that would become Atlanta's top-drawing blues band. Upon hearing LIVE AT THE MOONSHADOW (Landslide), the band's second release, The Washington Post declared, ""Tinsley Ellis is a legitimate guitar hero."" After cutting two more Heartfixers albums for Landslide, COOL ON IT (featuring Tinsley's vocal debut) and TORE UP (with vocals by blues shouter Nappy Brown), Ellis was ready to head out on his own. Ellis sent a copy of the master tape for his solo debut to Bruce Iglauer at Alligator Records. ""I had heard COOL ON IT,"" recalls Iglauer, ""and I was amazed. I hadn't heard Tinsley before, but he played like the guys with huge international reputations. It wasn't just his raw power; it was his taste and maturity that got to me. It had the power of rock but felt like the blues. I knew I wanted to hear more of this guy.""

&gt; GEORGIA BLUE, Tinsley's first Alligator release, hit an unprepared public by surprise in 1988. Critics and fans quickly agreed that a new and original guitar hero had emerged. ""Dazzling musicianship pitched somewhere between the exhilarating volatility of rock and roll and the passion of urban blues,"" raved the Los Angeles Times. Before long, Alligator arranged to reissue COOL ON IT and TORE UP, thus exposing Tinsley's blistering earlier music to a growing fan base."" The Chicago Tribune celebrated the release by saying, ""Ellis takes classic, Southern blues-rock workouts and jolts them to new life with a torrid axe barrage.""

&gt; Tinsley's next release, 1989's FANNING THE FLAMES, further expanded the guitarist's hero status. By now his talents as a songwriter equaled his guitar prowess. Guitar World shouted, ""Ellis stands alongside Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter, and that ain't just hype."" 1992's TROUBLE TIME added guests Peter Buck (R.E.M.) and keyboardist Chuck Leavell (Rolling Stones), and brought even more critical acclaim Ellis' way. The song &gt;Highwayman received airplay on commercial rock radio stations across the country. ""Alive, kicking and drenched in sweat,"" declared The Washington Post.

&gt; 1994's STORM WARNING was Ellis' true breakthrough. Recorded live in the studio with his road-savvy band and produced by Eddy Offord (John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Yes), the album was a tour-de-force of smoking guitar workouts and radio-friendly blues rockers. Features and reviews ran in Rolling Stone, The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and in many other national and regional publications. His largest audience by far came when NBC Sports ran a feature on Atlanta's best blues guitarist during their 1996 Summer Olympic Coverage viewed by millions of people all over the world.

&gt; FIRE IT UP followed in 1997. Produced by the legendary Tom Dowd (Allman Brothers, Ray Charles), the album featured Ellis' blazing guitar playing and expressive, soulful vocals in better form than ever. With Dowd's deft production touch--along with Tinsley's fiery road band and a host of talented musicians, including famed bassist Donald ""Duck"" Dunn on seven songs--Ellis reached new heights, coming up with some of the best performances of his career. The Associated Press called the CD, ""A solid heaping of blues...a mixture of well-written originals and covers all held together with scorching guitar and a big voice to carry his sharply written lyrics.""

&gt; A move to Capricorn Records in 2000 saw Ellis revisiting his Southern roots with KINGPIN. Unfortunately, the label folded soon after the CD's release. In 2002, he joined the Telarc label, producing two well-received albums of soul-drenched blues-rock, HELL OR HIGH WATER and THE HARD WAY. All the while, Ellis never stopped touring. ""A musician never got famous staying home,"" he's quick to note.

&gt; Ellis has played in all 50 states, as well as Canada, Europe, Australia and South America. Whether he's out with his own band or sharing stages with The Allman Brothers, Robert Cray, Koko Taylor or Widespread Panic, he averages over 150 performances a year, bringing his fast-moving, high-energy, guitar-drenched performances to fans all over the world. Live, there's simply no one better at igniting a crowd, jamming with focus and purpose...

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

&gt; Robert Randolph &amp; The Family Band is a multicultural American blues and funk band composed of Robert Randolph, Marcus Randolph (drums), Danyel Morgan (bass), and Jason Crosby (organ). Frontman Robert Randolph was trained as a pedal steel guitarist in the House of God Church, Keith Dominion, in Nashville, TN and makes prominent use of the instrument in the band's music. The group's sound is inspired by successful 1970s funk bands such as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Sly &amp; the Family Stone, another multicultural band comprised of former members of the Church of God in Christ. Randolph himself has also stated that his main influence as a guitarist is Stevie Ray Vaughan.

&gt; Although he has only put out two albums, Rolling Stone magazine named Randolph as one of the 100 greatest guitar players of all time.

&gt; Robert Randolph set the music world on fire in late 2000 and early 2001 when he began to play his first club dates in New York City. These were a result of being discovered playing his pedal steel guitar at the first Sacred Steel Convention in Florida in the spring of 2000. Randolph started playing the pedal steel as a teenager and started playing at his Orange, NJ, church just outside of Newark. The House of God Church, an African-American Pentecostal denomination, has been implementing steel guitars (or ""Sacred Steel"") in services since the '30s, with the pedal steel in particular being introduced during the '70s. Randolph learned to play by watching other steel players in his church. Jim Markel was the man who heard Randolph play at the Sacred Steel Convention, and he later introduced him to his friend, Gary Waldman. Waldman, who already managed several artists, invited Randolph to audition for him. Waldman and Markel began to manage Randolph; they played the audition tape over the phone to Matt Hickey, talent buyer at Manhattan's Bowery Ballroom. Hickey signed Randolph on as the opening act for the North Mississippi Allstars and it was the beginning of a very large explosion. Within a month, Randolph was playing to thousands with Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood (MMW) at the Beacon Theater. Allstars and MMW keyboardist John Medeski liked Randolph so much that he asked him to record an all-instrumental gospel/blues album with them. The Word was released in August 2001 to great critical and popular acclaim. Randolph's own band, the Family Band, includes cousins Danyell Morgan and Marcus Randolph (bass and drums, respectively) and John Ginty (Hammond B-3 organ). Their career began with opening gigs for a variety of blues, jazz-funk, and jam bands such as the Derek Trucks Band, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe, and Soulive. Headlining gigs became the norm within a few months. Robert Randolph &amp; the Family Band released Live at the Wetlands in fall 2001. 2003's Unclassified and its single, ""I Need More Love,"" introduced Randolph to an even wider audience. Colorblind followed in 2006 Read more on Last.fm.

Playing along to some older songs by The Script really helped me find ways to play proper melodies with the pentatonics and find ways to add the extra notes from the diatonic scales. Their song ""Breakeven"" has a mostly pentatonic melody but with a few extra notes in the verses and chorus, but nothing complicated at all.

As far as guitar players go, Derek Trucks is the best of the best for just straight pentatonic-based lines. He does use quite a bit of notes from major and mixolydian (and sometimes lydian, too) but it's kinda based around a pentatonic framework.

Keep in mind the biggest hurdle is realizing you don't have to be technical *at all*. You don't have to do all that much, you can just play a simple melody with 2-3 notes and be super golden.

Damon Lindelof is the best example of this. He wrote Lost which people loved, than hated the ending.  He also wrote Cowboys &amp; Aliens, Prometheus and Tommorowland which both have a ton of writing and story problems.

But people love The Leftovers.

Chris Terrio did a great job with Argo, but I do blame him at least in part for Batman V Superman which doesn't have a good story. The entire outline of the film is poor IMHO, same with Justice League. It's clear that it's not a well written film mad poor by the director but just a mess of a dumb plot line made equally bad by a director who only cares about cool moments over making a coherent overall film.

I have zero hope for Star Wars 9 to be good as the writers are:

J.J Abrams, J.J. Abrams &amp; Chris Terrio	with Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly listed as Co-writers.

Derek Connolly also worked on such great scripts as Kong Skull Island, Jurassic World and Monster Trucks.

Star Wars 9 is going to have the dumbest plot line on any Star Wars film that tries hard to follow ""The rule of cool"" by bringing back the Emperor, never explaining anything and ending on some big lightsaber fight that makes no sense.",,2019-05-05 01:03:35,1557011015,,,{},emiutsa,False,t3_bkeakc,False,True,t1_emh2otb,/r/freefolk/comments/bkeakc/new_released_interview/emiutsa/,1557011026,1,True,0.9444,,False,freefolk,t5_37tpy,0.0,1557491403.0

The cleans are nice and chimey on the bigger models like the Bassman and high-power Twin, but they start to break up relatively early.

Brownface - kind of a transitional period, sounds somewhere in between Tweed and Blackface/Silverface. Similar to tweed but with tighter bass and slightly less mids. They were only made for a couple years, so they're some of the most rare and expensive Fender amps out there. Check out ZZ Top's first album, all of the guitar parts were recorded with a brownface Deluxe. 

Blackface/silverface - the ultimate clean tone imo, has a beautiful sparkly, lush sound with scooped (i.e. less) mids. Excellent pedal platform, arguably the most versatile of the classic Fender amps. With the wrong speakers they can sound harsh when cranked up to overdrive, but with the right speakers they have a great unique breakup that is a lot tighter, more focused, and clearer than the tweed and brownface amps. Leans more towards a purely ""blues"" sound than a rock sound when cranked, think SRV or Derek Trucks. They were also the first Fender amps to feature built-in reverb. I grouped blackface and silverface together because they generally sound 95% the same, with the later '70s silverface amps sounding a little colder and harsher.

Blackface/silverface is my favorite, and is what comes to mind first when I think of ""the Fender sound.""

Philadelphia Ballot Questions

1. Public Safety Enforcement Officers

Shall the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter be amended to require the establishment of “Public Safety Enforcement Officers” to assist the Police Department in regulating the flow of traffic, supporting special events, and enforcing quality of life crimes; to enforce municipal code violations relating to the quality of life in the City’s neighborhoods; and to perform such other duties as their appointing authority or Council may require?

If Philly voters approve this measure (sponsored by Council president Darrell Clarke and passed in March by a 13-4 vote), you’ll soon be seeing 100 or so unarmed  Public Safety Enforcement Officers on city streets, assisting police in an effort to unsnarl clogged traffic and deal with “quality of life” problems in Center City (e.g.: double-parked delivery trucks) and other neighborhoods. Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., already deploy similar officers on their streets, but the model seems to be the  New York City Police Department’s Traffic Enforcement Agents and its Auxiliary Police Force, and this measure has been endorsed by the Philadelphia Police Department, the Center City District and the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia. But critics are annoyed by the proposal’s lack of details. And the Fraternal Order of Police is opposed because of a fear that the Public Safety Police Officer program could cost police jobs. The FOP also asserts that state law limits traffic-enforcement duty to police.

2. Office of Immigrant Affairs

Shall The Philadelphia Home Rule Charter be amended to establish and define the functions of the Office of Immigrant Affairs, headed by a Director of Immigrant Affairs?

The City’s  Office of Immigrant Affairs already exists: Mayor Kenney created it with a 2016 executive order, so passage of this measure wouldn’t “establish” it but would make it a permanent part of City government. In 2014, Philadelphia voters approved a similar proposal that cemented Mayor Nutter’s Office of Sustainabilty in the Charter. The OIA offers language access plans, monthly legal clinics, after-school programs for youth and a citizenship-test preparation program. Similar offices exist in many major U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco.

According to a 2018 PEW report, Philadelphia’s fast–growing immigrant population stands at about 232,000 (some 50,000 of them undocumented), or approximately 15% of the city’s total population and 19% of its workers. The largest percentages come from Asia and Latin America (though the fastest growing group is Africans), and the largest concentration of immigrants can be found in South and Northeast Philadelphia.

3. Remove gender-specific language from the City Charter

Shall The Philadelphia Home Rule Charter be amended to change certain gender specific references (such as “councilman,” “councilmen,” and “Councilmanic”) to gender neutral references (such as “councilmember,” “councilmembers,” and “Council”)?

Passage of this Ballot Question would scrub male and female references to City Council members from the City Charter in February. It was introduced by Council member Derek Green, and Council passed it unanimously.  But approval wouldn’t remove all gender references from the Charter. Currently, the chairs of various boards and commissions are referred to as “chairmen,” and changing that would require another ballot question. Council member Green told Philly.com in February that he plans to pursue following the vote on this question.

Philadelphia is late in the game regarding gender-neutral language. New York voters, for instance, removed gender-specific language from their state constitution in 2001. And similar measures were approved last year in Nashville and Baltimore County, MD.

4. A call to raise the minimum wage in Philadelphia

Shall The Philadelphia Home Rule Charter be amended to call on the General Assembly to either increase the Pennsylvania minimum wage now, so that it reaches $15 an hour, in stages, by 2025; or allow the City of Philadelphia to itself provide for a decent, family sustaining, living wage for working Philadelphians?

Since only the state can change the minimum wage for most private-sector workers, passage of this ballot question  (sponsored by Council member Cherelle Parker) won’t raise anybody’s salary: It’s little more than a public-opinion poll whose results will be enshrined in Philadelphia’s Home Rule Charter, along with resolutions urging the end of apartheid in South Africa, support for universal health insurance and. withdrawal of U.S troops from Iraq. And in 2015 Philadelphians voted to abolish the School Reform Commission---three years before the state did it.

In 2014, Philadelphia voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that actually did raise the minimum wage for employees of many city subcontractors to $12 an hour. That was one of various minimum-wage referenda have appeared on ballots around the country in recent years, and voters in Denver will face one this May 7. Last year,  voters in Flagstaff, AZ, voted down a proposal todecrease that city’s minimum wage",,2019-04-22 22:58:15,1555966695,,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eliv73e,False,t3_bg4jz7,,True,t1_elilse8,/r/philadelphia/comments/bg4jz7/have_you_ever_complained_about_philadelphia_then/eliv73e/,1555966696,20,True,0.9861,,False,philadelphia,t5_2qh24,,1556057756.0

I’ll probably be vilified if anyone actually reads this but I think there are a lot of parallels between a some current active guitarists and the ‘guitar gods’ of previous generations.

Derek Trucks is a very reminiscent of Duane and plays with about as much feel and originality as anyone that’s come before him while still being fervently reverent to the old masters.

John Mayer, though more pop-driven in some of his work, is a disciple of everything Stevie Ray. Stevie’s playing was more intense and hard-hitting, but you can definitely tell where Mayer school of thought originated. Also, Mayer is thought of as more of a pop icon by most people but he’s a lot like SRV in the way that most of the music-listening public is at least aware of him, much like Vaughan in his day.

Welcome to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ... and now Buffalo.

Every week, massive container ships arrive at New York Harbor, after passing under the raised Bayonne Bridge between Staten Island and New Jersey. Workers quickly unload thousands of blocky containers at the port and put them on big trucks, sending the goods to their destination while clearing the way for the next ship to come in.

It's a system that's worked well for years, but now, the New York City port is too busy to handle the volume that it gets.

That's where the vision behind creating a new transportation and logistics hub along the Buffalo waterfront could come into play.

Instead of unloading the containers at the New York port and putting them on trucks there, the idea is to unload the containers onto a train that would take them to Buffalo, where they would be put on trucks in a new depot at the Buffalo Lakeside Commerce Park and sent off to their destinations.

Backers, which include Amherst-based Uniland Development Co., say it's a win-win proposition. The Port Authority needs inland distribution facilities located on rail lines to handle its growing volume. For Buffalo, the logistics hub would take advantage of the city's location within 500 miles of most major metro areas in the Northeast, Midwest and eastern Canada, while also bringing new jobs to the area.

""It’s very significant,"" said Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown. ""Anything that we can do to enhance the visibility of the city and do it in a way that we are recruiting a company in one of four targeted industries is a very, very positive thing. And this will make us even more attractive for development.""

The project is a new twist on a decade-old vision to focus on logistics, given Western New York's location on the Great Lakes, its proximity to Canada, and its position along major highway and rail lines. Some 26,000 shipping containers already make their way back and forth between New York and Buffalo every year, by truck.

""We are a logistics hub. We have been since the terminus of the Erie Canal,"" said Craig W. Turner, executive director of the collaboration, called Buffalo Niagara International Trade Gateway Organization, or ITGO. ""What we started to do years ago was start to market it that way.""

Most significantly, supporters say, Buffalo is part of the third-largest and fastest-growing metropolitan region in North America — the horseshoe zone stretching from Toronto to Rochester. The import demand of that major region, coupled with the presence of a large trans-shipment facility in the area, would result in more shipping containers being emptied locally and then reloaded with exports from manufacturers in Western New York and southern Ontario.

That, in turn, addresses a longstanding shortage that has hampered those companies' growth, and even hindered Invest Buffalo Niagara and Empire State Development Corp. when they try to lure companies to locate here.

""For our purposes here, it's about the containers. We have a very good ecosystem here, except for the containers,"" Turner said. ""The whole purpose of this facility is to capture those containers for use by manufacturers in our region on both sides of the border.""


ITGO was started by companies such as BorderWorx Logistics, Roar Logistics, Speed Global, Sonwil Distribution, Wendel Architecture &amp; Engineering, law firm Phillips Lytle, the Peace Bridge Authority and the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission. It's led by Turner, who is also president of World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara and founder and president of Momentum Public Affairs.

The organization grew out of a working group that was created to implement recommendations made by the Greater Buffalo Niagara Regional Transportation Council in 2010, which highlighted the potential of logistics to become a driving force in the Buffalo Niagara economy.

Until now, the idea of Buffalo as a train-based shipping hub for New York City has been mostly a vague concept, based around years of conversations, and a five-year-old memorandum of understanding that designated the Buffalo Niagara region as a ""strategic international gateway"" for the Port Authority.

The agreement called for joint marketing and messaging to ocean carriers and businesses, data-sharing, and collaboration on freight strategy, and Port Authority representatives sit on ITGO's advisory group. ""We have a great relationship with them,"" Turner said.

Officials first discussed the idea of a depot in Buffalo several years and even spoke with CSX, but it fell by the wayside until two years ago. Now, ITGO is taking a major step toward making it a reality, by acquiring the necessary real estate.

The Buffalo Urban Development Corp. on Tuesday agreed to sell a 20.34-acre parcel of land at 255 Ship Canal Parkway - in the Buffalo Lakeside Commerce Park in South Buffalo - to Uniland for $509,000. That's $25,019 per acre.

Uniland - which signed on to the project last year - will work with ITGO to develop a logistics hub at the site, enabling Buffalo to become an ""inland port"" location for the Port Authority. There are four large freight trains a week that go to Buffalo from the port in New York.

That will capitalize on the expansion of international shipping at the Port of New York &amp; New Jersey, which has been overwhelmed since the Panama Canal was enlarged and the Bayonne Bridge was raised to accommodate much larger ""Panamax"" ships that handle 17,000 containers each.

""They were congested even before they enlarged the Panama Canal, and then with that enlargement, they realized they need relief,"" said David Stebbins, BUDC executive vice president. ""They can’t unload everything at the Port Authority. They need to ship stuff inland, on trains, and have them unload in different areas.""


Train tracks are already close to the Buffalo Lakeside Commerce Park. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News)

The Port Authority had already invested $600 million over the last decade to increase efficiency, including with direct access to rail lines. But before December 2017, when the Bayonne Bridge was raised, the biggest ship that came to New York had 12,000 containers.

Also adding to the pressure are new federal rules about how long truck drivers can go before they have to stop and rest for the day, setting a new limit of 10 hours at a time. That's not enough time to get to Buffalo and back to New York in one day, let alone more distant cities, so it changed the economics of those trip for shippers. Instead of sending a second driver or paying for a hotel, they decided to turn to rail.

Two years ago, the Port Authority asked ITGO officials again about the rails-to-trucks idea. Talks progressed, and Uniland approached the group after learning about the concept. The developer and ITGO then approached BUDC in late 2018, and negotiated the purchase agreement.

The proposed site is located on the eastern side of Buffalo Lakeside Commerce Park, between Sonwil Distribution and Certainteed. It has direct access to CSX Rail's main line, with a short road being completed to link them.

Preliminary plans by architects at Wendel Cos. call for a 20,000-square-foot facility with 40 loading docks, plus some office space, but Turner said it could ultimately be larger. It's also expected to include solar panels and electric-vehicle charging stations. Ultimately, it could handle at least 30,000 containers annually.

The cost is still uncertain, as is the time frame.

""It'll be a boon to the region if we can get this up and running soon,"" Turner said. ""It was an idea scribbled on a napkin seven or eight years ago, and all of a sudden we're moving toward something. It's going to be a benefit for manufacturers in the region.""

But it's not a sure thing.

""There's no guarantee that Buffalo has that yet, but the hope is that by developing this facility, it gives us a leg up to be able to attract that type of business here,"" Stebbins said. ""Once we have that core piece of infrastructure, we have the ability to attract other businesses that need better access to port facilities.""",,2019-04-17 20:53:52,1555527232,,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",el4gxdx,False,t3_bdysv5,,True,t3_bdysv5,/r/Buffalo/comments/bdysv5/buffalo_as_an_extension_of_nycs_port_authority/el4gxdx/,1555527242,1,True,0.9981,,False,Buffalo,t5_2qi6i,,1555686431.0

&gt; Robert Charles Guidry (February 21, 1938 – January 14, 2010), known as Bobby Charles, was an American rhythm &amp; blues singer and songwriter.

&gt; An ethnic Cajun, Charles was born in Abbeville, Louisiana, and grew up listening to Cajun music and the country and western music of Hank Williams. At the age of 15, he heard a performance by Fats Domino, an event that ""changed my life forever,"" he recalled.

&gt; Charles helped to pioneer the south Louisiana musical genre known as swamp pop. His compositions include the hits See You Later, Alligator, which he initially recorded himself as Later Alligator, but which is best known from the cover version by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, and Walking to New Orleans, written for Fats Domino.

&gt; (I Don't Know Why) But I Do was an early 1960s song that Charles composed, which Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry had a major hit with, and which was on the soundtrack of the 1994 film Forrest Gump. His composition ""Why Are People Like That?"" was on the soundtrack of the 1998 film Home Fries.

&gt; Because of his south Louisiana–influenced rhythm and blues vocal style, Charles has sometimes been thought to be black, when in fact he was white.

&gt; Charles was invited to play with the Band at their November 26, 1976, farewell concert, The Last Waltz, at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. In the concert, Charles played ""Down South in New Orleans"", with the help of Dr. John and the Band. That song was recorded and released as part of the triple-LP The Last Waltz box set. The performance was also captured on film by director Martin Scorsese, but did not appear in the final, released theatrical version. Charles did, however, appear briefly in a segment of the released film—in the concert's final song, I Shall Be Released. In that segment, his image is largely blocked from view during the performance. That song, sung by Bob Dylan and pianist Richard Manuel, featured backup vocals from the entire ensemble, including Charles.

&gt; He co-wrote the song Small Town Talk with Rick Danko of the Band. Promises, Promises (The Truth Will Set You Free) was co-written with Willie Nelson.

&gt; Charles continued to compose and record (he was based out of Woodstock, New York, for a time) and in the 1990s he recorded a duet of Walking to New Orleans with Domino.

&gt; In September 2007, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame honored Charles for his contributions to Louisiana music with an induction.

&gt; Charles collapsed in his home near Abbeville and died on January 14, 2010.

&gt; ----------------

&gt; Bobby Charles was actually born Robert Charles Guidry in Abbeville, Louisiana circa 1938. A regional New Orleans Swamp Pop fave, whose best known song was ""See Ya Later Alligator"". That track became a top 20 hit on Chess records in 1955, after a southern Louisiana record store owner hipped the Chicago based R&amp;B label. Bill Haley may have made the song even more popular and accessible a year later, but Charles was first out the gate. He recorded more early self composed sides for Chess like ""Ain't Gonna Do It No More"" &amp; ""Take It Easy Greasy"", ""No Use Knockin"" featuring hot backing musicians like Lee Allen on sax, Charles Williams on drums and Justin Adams on gtr. 

&gt; By 1958, Bobby Charles (aka on songwriting credits as R.Guidry) started releasing material on The Imperial label. After a year of nominal success  on Imperial the Bobby Charles name began showing up mostly doing other writers material on a variety of mainly one off singles on labels like Farie, Hub City, Jewel and Paula until he simply seems to disappear from the record biz circa 1965. 

&gt; By 1972, Charles had resurfaced in Woodstock, NY and released three singles from a self titled album on Bearsville in the early 70's, including production and co-writing credits from  Rick Danko of The Band. Bobby Charles later appeared with Dr. John at The Band's 1978 farewell concert captured on film in The Last Waltz.

&gt; He eventually began putting out albums &amp; later CDs on the homespun indie Rice N Gravy imprint. Other musical collaborators with Charles over the Rice N' Gravy years are notables like Neil Young, Dan Penn, Willie Nelson, Sonny Landreth, Derek Trucks, Wardell Quezergue, Rufus Thibodeaux, Fats Domino and Jon Cleary.

&gt; Charles most lasting contributions beyond his early Chess rock n roll rave ups, may have been as a songwriter, contributing what some might call Fats Domino's signature tune ""Walkin To New Orleans"", as well as Clarence Frogman Henry's biggest chart hit ""But I Do"". He is basically retired, living in Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico, but recently shared co-writing credits on six of 13 tracks on the 2008 Dr. John album ""City That Care Forgot"" and came through with ""Homemade Songs"", his first release since his 2004 collection of rarities, ""Last Train to Memphis"". As Bob Dylan said in the liner notes to his 2008 album : 'The boy could sing like a bird. He still does, as a matter of fact.""

&gt; Bobby Charles passed away January 14, 2010, at age 71, after collapsing at his home in Abbeville, Louisiana. He was due to release a new album, ""Timeless,"" featuring new material. He saw the final design for the album's artwork, but died only weeks before its scheduled Feb. 23 release. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

John Mayer errantly thought it was his turn, so he turns on his blues face and starts playing, notices that B.B. is still interacting with Derek so John looks around a bit and stops...turns off his blues face, then cranks it right back up when it's his turn.

I'm a huge SRV fan, and he regularly made the same faces during the same point of many songs so he clearly had a feel for when to turn it on and off.  Big long bends? Oh that painful face. No doubt he did sometimes ""feel"" it.  He mentioned one time that people expect a show every time you appear, whether or not you're really feeling it. That makes sense to me.

My son said once that I was making a face when I played and I realized it was when I was making 1 and 1/2 bends...because that's when I would most likely break a string and I've been hit in the face that way...so I was actually pulling away and squinting a bit in anticipation of breaking a string....blues face. haha",,2019-04-07 15:53:15,1554645195,,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ekb9v1u,False,t3_baexbo,,True,t3_baexbo,/r/Guitar/comments/baexbo/discussion_anyone_else_have_a_terrible_guitar/ekb9v1u/,1554645196,5,True,0.7777,,False,Guitar,t5_2qi79,,1554918946.0

Derek Trucks.

A lot of jamband fandom (vibe &amp; culture) are rich kids that don't have to work and can afford to travel a lot to see and even follow bands around seeing multiple shows. They have both the money and the time to do these things. They come from good families, have good educations and do lots of good drugs. They also buy up all the tickets so it can be difficult for the normal people with jobs to see the bands when they pass though their town. If you do go to the show you have to deal with these people.

910,,,punisher2404,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4rnzr,False,,,"The fact is the power of his and many of his day's influence is incalculable, even the mere fact that Eddie Van Halen credits a Cream era Eric Clapton as one of if not the greatest of his musical prodding and influence to play the guitar, and then you look at the people Van Halen influenced, and so on. And you begin to see, yes some of the Rock n Roll'rs of the past, did and said and acted in ways that today viewed from the modern (or any non-drug-addled) lens is rephrensible. But when you go beyond the mere novelty of ""Oh didn't you know he said such and such when he was blackout drunk and coked out infront of an audience in the 70s?"" and learn to find that basically his entire autobiography is an apology to those words and the countless things and words he himself has fessed up to saying (years before any pressuring of modern day outrage mobility, for better or worse, worse only in that many people won't take the time to read it all) but the fact was, I have said some pretty awful things when I was drunk, and being a rockstar is even worse when you have an audience listening to it. 

So given that he's dedicated much of his adult life to righting any wrongs or shortcomings he made in his life, an example would be when he sold most if not all of his prized and cherished collection of guitars to help fund and finance a drug and alcohol rehab center in Antigua. It's called Crossroads Centre Antigua, and it has helped change many lives for the better, many of whom are locals and those who live as natives to the west indies by offering free 'scholarships' to treatment and has literally saved the lives in a more tangible level of human beings by the creation and mere existence and operation of that rehab center than most any other rock musician combined. So to any nay-sayers and people who have chosen to dislike Clapton, for whatever reason, and if that's the case I don't blame you, but you're limiting the breadth of your understanding of the true scope and historical lineage of rock and popular music in the past 50 or so years whether you like it or not. 
 
I don't like the fact that Chuck Berry farted on a sex worker he was having sex with but I'm not going to stop listening to Maybelline or You Never Can Tell or Roll Over Beethoven because he did that, and that guy lived never asked for forgiveness or created some Farted On Sex Worker rehab center to help Sex Workers who have been Farted on by Rock n Roll icons. But Clapton basically did that for drugs and alcohol, and his past words and actions, I can't even begin to imagine what Clapton's life has been like, He never had a mother, and when he found out who his mother was, it was his sister. Being a guitar prodigy and playing and being a ""God""-like guitar player ever since he was a teenager into his 20s and basically his entire life, the whole Layla/Boyd/Heroin days with Derek and The Dominos, and then beginning a relationship with Alcohol, being suicidal and finally having a bastion of love by the birth of his son, living clean and finally with a hope for a greater fuller life, the very moment his son tragically dies by falling out of a window under the care of a maid, tunneling that pain into the song Tears In Heaven and having the suprise smash success of the Unplugged album in 1992, and a revival and in the late 90s created The Crossroads Centre in Antigua and has held various Crossroads Festivals with acts ranging from ZZ Top and the Allman Brothers and Jeff Beck and BB King and Buddy Guy and Gary Clark Jr, Taj Mahal, Johnny Winter, John Mayer, Robert Randolph, Derek Trucks, Jimmy Vaughan, Hubert Sumlin, etc etc etc. They're great, and their entire purpose is to give money to Crossroads to continue to provide free treatment to hundreds of native islanders of the west indies and also provide treatment to people from all over the world who go there for world class addiction treatment, those men and women are able to live happy fulfilled and enriched lives that can in turn be a positive contribution to the world around them, the beauty of pain and hurt is the opportunity to make right those wrongs by living a life meriting the redemption of past actions and giving credence to a life symbolic in offering such redemption to others as others had to you. 

And I get that people who maybe havent gone through stuff like that might struggle with seeing that arch and thus can only focus on some nasty words that a very different man once said in a drug and alcohol addled state of oblivion 40 years ago. I apologize if my words about farting on a sex worker was offensive to anyone by the way, I don't believe any one deserves that.

913,,,nickg420,,,,[],,,,text,t2_km41a,False,,,"My house growing up was always filled with music. My grandmother would stack up old Motown and soul records to play while she did the house work stuff during the day. Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Sam Cooke, The Miracles, Temptations, Marvin Gaye....I still love that music....

My father always listened to Classic Rock and so I was heavily influenced heavily by his tastes as well. 

On New Years Eve in 1989 my father took me to see The Allman Brothers band at The Macon City Auditorium. I was only 9 years old at the time but it was definitely the first time that I had ever experienced live music and such passion pouring out into the playing. It was something that never left me...Even today there are artists and bands that I like their music, that I refuse to see live because they simply just ""go through the motions"" on stage.

The next thing that forever influenced my musical taste was when I got a CD player a few years later. I bought 3 CDs. Being from Georgia I had to buy REM ""Out of Time"", but I also picked up Soundgarden ""Badmotorfinger"" and what would forever change how I felt about music for years....Pearl Jam ""Ten"". That album probably did as much for my musical tastes as the concert at 9 years old did.

I've had several bands throughout the years that have hit me like that again....Counting Crows ""August and Everything After"", the songwriting on that album is unreal, Adam Duritz is such a good song writer. Every Tool or APC Album ever made, and seeing them live....Seeing Arcade Fire live....All hit me like that first experience at 9 years old.

More recently it's only happened watching Derek Trucks play guitar. I watched him play as a kid when he was just a little older than I was and I would be amazed. Now he is probably one of, if not ***THE*** greatest guitar player playing right now. He's just unreal...Every time I see him I say, ""There's no way he'll ever be better than he is right now..."" and every time I see him, he's always a little better than the time before.

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

Sometimes I play that 5e3 through a pair of these Weber 10""ers that were designed for Derek Trucks. Real midrangey, and with a very tight, firm bottom. Totally different beast. Still has some of that flub going on, because some of that is the OT/speaker interaction, but very different than the 12A125A, which is their classic Tweed sound (well, a little brighter than classic, but very close), which just dies on the bottom end. But that is a pretty cool sound in it's own right. Perfect for those dirty blues. 

Anyway, yeah, speakers are huge. I really feel that as far as just tones, they're as important as the amp, and far more important than the guitar.

Guys treat things like it's the old boys club.  They wanna be themselves and not feel like they have to walk on eggshells because a girl's around.  But they're wrong.  You shouldn't have to disclose your gender or identity if you don't want to. 

&gt;Somehow he turns this into a problem that I'm a bad and weird person for hiding the fact I'm a woman and trying to trick people into being ""just friends""???

Some women hide the fact that they are so they don't get harassed for being a woman.  What's wrong with having female friends?  Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you're a piece of ass to be handed around.

It's immature and thoughtless idiots like Derek that drive women away from these common interests and then complain that there's no chicks around.

&gt; Grace Potter &amp; the Nocturnals is an American rock band from Vermont. Formed in 2002 in Waitsfield by drummer Matt Burr, guitarist Scott Tournet, and singer Grace Potter, they began their career as an indie band, self-producing their albums and touring extensively in the jam bands and music festivals circuit, playing as many as 200 gigs in a year. In 2005 they signed for Hollywood Records and have subsequently released albums encompassing rock sub-genres such as blues rock, folk rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Their third, self-titled album (released in 2010) was a major commercial success, topping the iTunes charts and receiving international attention.

&gt; Grace Potter whose dynamic vocal ability has drawn comparisons to legends Bonnie Raitt, Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin and more recently Sheryl Crow and  Joan Osborne. Her unique style behind the Hammond B-3 and piano is also gaining widespread recognition. The original lineup included Scott Tournet (guitar/slide guitar), Matthew Burr (drums/percussion), and Bryan Dondero (upright/electric bass). After Dondero parted ways with the Nocturnals in March 2009, they brought in Catherine Popper (bass) and also added Benny Yurco (rhythm guitar).

&gt; Grace Potter &amp; the Nocturnals is an American rock band from Vermont. Formed in 2002 in Waitsfield by drummer Matt Burr, guitarist Scott Tournet, and singer Grace Potter, they began their career as an indie band, self-producing their albums and touring extensively in the jam bands and music festivals circuit, playing as many as 200 gigs in a year. In 2005 they signed for Hollywood Records and have subsequently released albums encompassing rock sub-genres such as blues rock, folk rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Their third, self-titled album (released in 2010) was a major commercial success, topping the iTunes charts and receiving international attention.

&gt; Grace Potter whose dynamic vocal ability has drawn comparisons to legends Bonnie Raitt, Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin and more recently Sheryl Crow and  Joan Osborne. Her unique style behind the Hammond B-3 and piano is also gaining widespread recognition. The original lineup included Scott Tournet (guitar/slide guitar), Matthew Burr (drums/percussion), and Bryan Dondero (upright/electric bass). After Dondero parted ways with the Nocturnals in March 2009, they brought in Catherine Popper (bass) and also added Benny Yurco (rhythm guitar).

&gt; They have toured with national acts such as Taj Mahal, Trey Anastasio, Dave Matthews Band, The Black Crowes, Derek Trucks, Gov't Mule and Robert Cray.  Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. 

&gt; Remembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&amp;B, to rollicking good time rock &amp; roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.

&gt; Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.

&gt; By the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.

&gt; By 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.

&gt; Bishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.

&gt; As popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.

&gt; Delta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.

&gt; Elvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&amp;B, to a good dose of good-time rock &amp; roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

&gt; Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. 

&gt; Remembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&amp;B, to rollicking good time rock &amp; roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.

&gt; Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.

&gt; By the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.

&gt; By 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.

&gt; Bishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.

&gt; As popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.

&gt; Delta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.

&gt; Elvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&amp;B, to a good dose of good-time rock &amp; roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”

&gt; Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

&gt; The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek &amp; Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.

&gt; After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.

&gt; The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track ""Space Captain"" with additional members of Derek Trucks &amp; Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks &amp; Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform ""Space Captain"" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.

&gt; On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

999,,,benwintercoates,,,,[],,,,text,t2_2t9lm2r6,False,,,"This is always going to have subjective answers. Because after a certain point it comes down to preference, or different weight for different attributes. Personally, ranking guitarists feels a little silly, because if you are in the conversation the technical skill becomes close to negligible, and it comes down to whether you like the music. But, for the sake of these discussions I often put more weight into originality/influence than most. For that reason I have Jimi Hendrix at the top and someone like SRV, who I love, much further down. He certainly pushed limits and has incredible command over the guitar, and who knows how far he could have gone had he not died so young (same for Hendrix). But he is locked in the blues, and his innovation was moreso in his ability to do what others can do much better than them.  
  
Also, I will inevitably underrate guys like Eddie Van Halen because I’m not into his music. But anyways, these are the guys on my list:  
  
Hendrix, Jerry Garcia, Jeff Beck, Clapton, Prince, Duane Allman, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, SRV, Frusciante, George Harrison, Tim Reynolds, Gary Clark Jr., Jake Cinninger, David Gilmour, Trey Anastasio, BB king, Steve Vai, EVH.
  
This order is not set in stone and heavily influenced by my personal taste in music. Missing some legends, for sure, like Jimmy Page, but I stand by it.
