Everyone's circumstances are different. Everyone's risk tolerance is different. My point is that regardless of whether you roll the dice or play it safe, you are taking risks. We all have things that are outside our control, and we also have things that are within our control.

My tolerance for the financial risks has always been somewhat high. Even when I was a little kid and I wanted something and I had to buy it, my first thought was ""how can I make the money I need""... and not, ""let me save up my allowance over time"". As a result of the risks I've taken, I'm in the incredibly privileged position I am in.

20,[],,buttonstraddle,,,[],,,,text,t2_j4kkf,False,False,[],"While I agree with your initial point about how users have the choice to do what they want, meaning users can debase if they want, or they can fight to keep things as-is, I don't believe you fully understand Peter Todd's point..

In that same tweet he specifically says that he doesn't think that the community will ever inflate the supply, to the end that he thinks the community would rather Bitcoin die, rather than debase. If having to choose between those 2 options, I think it would be dumb for the community to die. 

Now how might things get to that point? Do you think Peter Todd is just dumb and hasn't thought things through? This guy has been in Bitcoin since near the beginning. In the tweet he specifically says in order to ""pay for security"". We have absolutely no precedent as to what is going to happen to the protocol as the mining rewards continue to half and dwindle. Right now, mining security against 51% attacks is ensured due to the inflation programmed to tail off over time. Hardly any fees are paid to miners. They make most of their money via the block subsidy.

Peter Todd is saying if that inflation continued over time, then miners would be ensured to make profit, which allows fees to remain low for users, and allows miners to continue to secure the protocol from reorg attacks. 

Its not an outlandish idea in that context. But I too believe that the community would never go for it. But you need to understand, that if you aren't in favor of paying via inflation, then you will be paying via txn fees. Its one or the other, or death. Miners need to be paid in some way in order for them to keep mining, otherwise the chain has low security and is worth nothing since anyone can attack it.",,2020-02-11 20:15:53,1581448553,,{},fhbrus3,False,t3_f28831,False,True,t1_fhb0xav,/r/Bitcoin/comments/f28831/bitcoin_explained_in_2_minutes_by_erik_voorhees/fhbrus3/,1581448566,1,True,False,Bitcoin,t5_2s3qj,0
21,[],,Live_Magnetic_Air,,,[],,,,text,t2_qt5favo,False,False,[],"The only known large holders of Nano are the Nano Foundation (2 million Nano I think) and the Bitgrail trustee holder which has 4 million Nano I think. I think the Bitgrail Nano will be distributed to Bitgrail hack claimants, so they'll be widely distributed. The Nano Foundation's remaining Nano will probably all be sold this year to cover NF costs.

The Florence court put all the blame for the Bitgrail hack squarely on the shoulders of the Bitgrail operator Francesco Firano. They also specifically stated that the Nano node was not at fault. The Bitgrail hack was due to Firano's incompetence in programming and security as well as his months long cover-up of the losses.

I haven't looked at a comprehensive analysis, but Nano might be less susceptible to 51% attacks than any other project. Generally speaking it costs less to get/rent enough hashpower to control a PoW network than it does to buy 51% of the supply. Nano's consensus doesn't rely on PoW and hashpower so that leaves only purchasing 51% of the supply. That would be prohibitively expensive, costing billions even now. And by bringing down the network the attacker would crash Nano's value and lose their investment. The other 51% attack vector on Nano is a bad actor accumulating 51% of the voting weight, but that seems unlikely. The community and wallet providers would not likely delegate voting weight to someone trying to accumulate a lot of it because that is suspicious. And representatives need to establish some standing in the community to get users to delegate their weight to them. As more exchanges trade Nano and more services build on it, Nano will be much more widely distributed and it would be very difficult to get 51% of the voting weight.

Nano has no inflation. All Nano that will ever exist are already in circulation. Nano is not a PoW consensus coin. It only uses PoW for spam prevention. Users must do PoW to send or receive a transaction, and this cost protects Nano from spam. Nano consensus is based on voting, and a user's voting weight is equal to their holdings. Nano's consensus is called Open Representative Voting (ORV).

I've heard that $40/month will get you a powerful Nano node and that even $5/month nodes work not bad. The Nano protocol is lightweight so running a node isn't expensive. There are no direct financial incentives to run a node, no rewards, no fees paid out. Businesses building on Nano and using Nano run nodes to support the network so that they can benefit from the fast, feeless, decentralized and secure tx's it provides. Exchanges, services and businesses run nodes to better interact with the network. Hobbyists run nodes for altruistic purposes, there will always be such people. There are over 10,000 Bitcoin nodes run by people who receive no financial incentive.

It might not be provable that Nano's distribution was fair, but I'm not worried. Early Bitcoin adopters accumulated hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin, some people got about a million, which is a large % of the Bitcoin supply. No one seems concerned about that and the distribution seems to have worked out ok. To get Nano from the distribution faucet, you only needed an Internet connection, not mining hardware, so Nano was available to many more people. Also by 2015, when Nano distribution started, many more people were aware of crypto than during Bitcoin's early days, so Nano's distribution was probably much wider. It's likely faucet accumulators have sold a lot of their Nano since the profits were high - Nano got up to $16 USD on Binance IIRC. It's known that people in Venezuela, Indonesia and Phillipines made a living from getting Nano from the faucet and selling it.

My main concerns about Nano are the developer fund which will probably run out this year, and whether solutions to all the spam attack vectors will be successfully implemented. Dynamic PoW is a spam-resistance measure already in place and that's great. A better PoW algorithm that is more spam-resistant is being researched. Ledger pruning will be part of a future update and will be important. There's also the attack vector of a bad actor opening up an enormous number of accounts - that attack can't be remedied by ledger pruning. A very high PoW for account opening has been floated as a solution to that particular attack.",,2020-02-11 20:15:43,1581448543,,{},fhbru6o,False,t3_f2c0ko,False,True,t3_f2c0ko,/r/nanocurrency/comments/f2c0ko/nanos_biggest_drawbackscons/fhbru6o/,1581448557,1,True,False,nanocurrency,t5_4br49,0

Ether is the token used by the Ethereum network, which essentially a trustless, distributed computer platform that can be used to execute smart contract scripts. 

That’s why bitcoin has a fixed cap (≈21 million) whereas Ether has no supply cap. Ethereum is not trying to be money, but because you need a value token to implement the game theory incentives that secure a public blockchain, ETH has value.

&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; El fracaso de la licitación de bonos y la decisión del Gobierno de pagar los intereses pero patear haste septiembre el capital inyectó presión en el mercado y el cambiario no fue la excepción.
&gt; 
&gt; El Banco Central ([BCRA](https://www.cronista.com/tags/BCRA)) tuvo que intervenir en la plaza para contener el alza que mostró el precio. El primer paso lo dio al inicio de la rueda, al subir su postura de venta a $ 61,12, 14 centavos arriba del lunes.
&gt; 
&gt; Como paso, la entidad vendió unos u$s 15 millones -según estiman analistas privados-.
&gt; 
&gt; El dólar minorista sumó 25 centavos en las pantallas del [Banco Nación](https://www.cronista.com/tags/Banco-Nacion) (BNA) hasta los $ 63,25, lo que dejó al dólar solidario en los $ 82,23.
&gt; 
&gt; En el mercado mayorista del MULC, el billete ganó 14 centavos y terminó en los $ 61,12.
&gt; 
&gt; ""El BCRA vendió algo, no toda la partida de los u$s 50 millones, habrá vendido entre u$s 15 y 17 millones"", calculó en diálogo con El Cronista Gustavo Quintana de PR Cambios.
&gt; 
&gt; Señaló que ""en un escenario de control de cambios, el volumen de negocios se reduce significativamente creando condiciones propicias para que el direccionamiento impuesto por el Banco Central opere sin dificultades y consiga el objetivo definido para determinar el valor del dólar en el mercado local"".
&gt; 
&gt; El volumen negociado volvió a ser escado, al ascender a u$s 153,297 millones, un 42% menos que en la rueda anterior, con u$s 26 millones registrados en el sector de futuros MAE.

Well long and memorized does not mean complex.  But assuming you meant you have a randomly generated 40 char passphrase, then yes, securing your seed words becomes less import for coins.

Do realize that Trezor Password Manager and U2F ignore the passphrase so these features should likely not be used if your practicing poor seed security.

&gt; Also, how would I go about recovering my funds in the even that I cannot obtain another trezor?

Through a BIP39/44 compatible wallet.  The most common BIP39/44 compatible bitcoin wallet is Electrum, though you have to enable BIP39 recovery.





Another thing that really interested me: how does the ""system"" (blockchain) know that my passphrase is correct? Unlike a regular database of user/passwords, how does it know if my passphrase is correct or not? I mean, if I can perfectly recall my passphrase, there will be less of a need for hardware wallets.. am I wrong? From what I've read, every set of seed words + passphrase will generate a new wallet.

I think either is fine, and nobody can predict what the future holds. 

New people buy BTC, but Growth wise, ETH definitely has the potential to skyrocket like no other coin. Last bull run, ETH led the charge and almost flipped BTC. And I would say that position (ETH pushing on BTC) is more technically supportable today. ETH pushing on BTC today would be a 7.5x in price, and I think that's more logical than it's current valuation. Make no mistake, ETH was completely oversold on the crash, has innovated more than any coin in the past 2 years, and has more working technology on it than anything else out there.

It has market economics (burn, gas, POS soon, DeFi opportunities) as well as insanely robust and large development ""team"" working on it. Pretty much everything USEFUL in crypto is running off ETH right now, and there are very exciting things coming in the very near future. ETH will have not only first mover advantage for smart contract/dAPPs, but also likely first to have a stress tested fully scalable working product. Combine first mover advantage with the latter, and it's a clear no-brainer to hold.

That being said new people buy BTC. Say what you want, new people for the forseable future will buy BTC. For some people BTC and Crypto are literally the same meaning. 

I remember watching a Joe Rogan podcast a few month ago and someone brought up Ethereum, and he hadn't even heard of it. He was asking ""what's that?"". This is a guy who has known about crypto for years. Obviously not super into it if he never heard of ETH before, but still, the point remains. 99% of people out there have never even heard of Ethereum. But they know Bitcoin.

I would say a rough 50-50 split is a good idea (1:1), but anywhere in the 2:1 to 1:2 ratio is a pretty safe spot. Myself, I'm heavier in ETH, (I'm more in the 2:1 ETH:BTC ratio), but only because I think there's just too much coming up in ETH in the next year or two, and also that it got disproportionally sold off during ICO mania panic selloff. So I think ETH is both oversold and also will absolutely inevitably flip BTC in the future. By future I mean the next TEN YEARS. Not 10 weeks. But long long term, I absolutely see ETH being rank 1, no question in my mind.

For now, I think your ratio is fine.

I also think now is not the time to play with alts (today is a bad day to make that statement, but I stand by it). And I will tell you why...

I think we are at the start of the next bullrun (well, we've kind of been here for a year, finding the floor). I made this prediction 2 years ago, that the recovery would have 3 phases...

1) Long term bouncing off various floors with the general public unaware. In this phase you wanted to hold BTC.

2) Long term holders who sold off in 2018 slowly coming back. These people will pick up some BTC/ETH, but largely they will BUY BACK INTO THEIR OLD PET PROJECTS. I believe we are here, have been here for a few months, and may be here for another month to a half year. In this phase, it's okay to be heavier in alts, but you really DON'T want to miss out of the next phase and be stuck in alts. Because once most old holders have bought back into their pet projects....

3) Hype phase starts. News gets out about BTC recovery, and new people come in. When new money starts coming in, the LAST thing you want to be in is your old pet projects from 2017. You want to be heavy in BTC and ETH. And because this could happen at any time, you really don't want to be last one off your pet project AND last one back into ETH/BTC. You will lose on both sides.

I made that prediction 2 years ago, and I'm pretty sure it's starting to play out. I could be wrong. I could be VERY wrong. But I think I'm right.

Then, I think new people come into BTC and to a lesser extent ETH, hold for half a year, and THEN start branching out.  Only at this point will it be a good idea to be significantly invested in alts. I would want until BTC hits at least 5x it's old high before I start getting massively into alts again. I see the next bullrun as being media-led, i.e. no-coiners will lead the next bull run as they come into this space. So 90% of my portfolio is BTC/ETH.

In 2017 I was 10% BTC, 10% ETH, 80% alts. 2018 I moved into almost 90% BTC, because I considered it the ""gold"" that people would jump to. That worked out well. Today, today, I'm staying roughly the same, 90% BTC/ETH, but myself I'm just heavier in ETH, but I still am 30% BTC in my portfolio, 60% ETH, 10% pet projects.

As for other big holders, there is no known entity on the level of a ripple.

The network is pretty resistant to a 51% attack, as you would need to control 51% of the coins (or have control of the nodes controlling 51% of the votes), neither of which is very feasible, and the former would wipe out your money from an attack.

Nanos arent generated, they were all created at once and distributed via complex capchas, there hasnt been a more fair distribution in crypto in my opinion that I'm aware of.

The incentives to run a node are in supporting the network and protecting your investment. People will incorrectly say this is a weakness, but its actually a strength. You don't have to look any farther than bitcoin nodes to see that thousands of people will freely run nodes because they want to, you also don't have to look any farther than bitcoin to see what happens when you incentivce people financially, centralization starts to occur. Nano is becoming more decentralized over time, not less.

If you want cons, you can argue that the dev fund will likely run out soon, but this has been planned for from the start and the project will continue.

The slow re delegation of votes away from defunct nodes is concerning imo, people argue that ORV is a major strength of nano and that it allows instant redegation in the event of an attack, but they aren't living in reality imo. There are principle reps that have been dead for months that still have enough votes pointing at them to be principle reps. Hopefully in the future wallets will have features that will make this less of an issue, but to some extent the security of nano will always rely on the education of the users, but that's the tradeoff for its incredible speed and scalability.",,2020-02-11 19:34:42,1581446082,,{},fhbnrs6,False,t3_f2c0ko,False,True,t3_f2c0ko,/r/nanocurrency/comments/f2c0ko/nanos_biggest_drawbackscons/fhbnrs6/,1581446100,1,True,False,nanocurrency,t5_4br49,0

Both rely on central entities to do the exchange and transfer on LN. Which means they are easily taken down: legally by authorities (they are MSB's and will be subject to KYC/AML) or by shutting down their banking relations (MasterCard/Visa aren't generally very kind to new competitors).

But as long as it works, why not?

It can also be seen as a way to pay your own LN invoices, so you can transfer money from your bank account to your own LN wallet (non-custodial preferably). A form of fiat on-ramp.

See ""Fee estimates"" and compare to the fee rate on your transaction. Since the price hit 10k the network has been a little more busy than usual.

I'd also recommend a different wallet tbh. If you want to keep brd for your other coins idc but for bitcoin I'd keep it in a bitcoin specific wallet. These two wallets are fairly easy to use and allow you to set custom fees. They do estimate fees too which are usually pretty accurate.

This is relative to other crypto and so I will not include problems with crypto currencies in general - the obvious one there is it is tough to create a new currency because of volatility based around speculation.

Non Technical:
1. Little adoption / Markesting
This is because it's a fairly newer coin to get attention and there isn't much marketing.
2. Small/centralized development team running out of funds.
3. Ongoing Lawsuits.
4. Bitgrail hack bad press.

Technical:
1. Unproven distribution.  Did Colin secretly send himself 10 million nano while running the initial faucet distribution?
mekane84: I think other coins have this same issue, like ETH ICO distribution
2. Lots of bandwidth use in voting process, especially by principal nodes.  Will this scale to world wide use?
mekane84: Devs are working on improving this I think.  Bandwidth should get cheaper in future
3. Node storage space.  Nano has no built in cap on transaction amount, so the ledger could grow to be very large, this is different than Bitcoin, of which we know exactly how large the ledger will be in the year 2030, assuming the block size cap remains as is.
mekane84; Storage is cheap and getting cheaper.  Bitcoiners want to run a node on their smart watch in 2030, at the cost of very few people being able to transact on the network.
4. No privacy
mekane84: I think off chain privacy solutions may be viable, and there are both good and bad things about privacy, sometimes you want to see the ledger for transparency, will privacy coins be illegal? not adopted? Is this why Monero is not on coinbase?  Privacy could also be coming to Nano in a distant future, there are already some proposals (PlasmaPower's).
5. Proof of Work vs. Fees spam prevention.  This is good for the end user in that all nano sent is received by the end user. But if the PoW cost needs to be high to prevent spam from ASICs, then will it take too long to generate for users sending transactions on their small devices / phones?
mekane84: Devs are working on trying to make the PoW algorithm ASIC resistent for this reason, but it will remain to be seen how this will play out.  There might be a limitation to how many transactions you can make on your phone if you are playing a game doing microtransactions - might not work on Nano, who knows we will see I guess.  Some of the wallets right now are doing the PoW for you for free, but is that feasible long term?  Maybe if they get enough advertisement revenue, we will see again.

Growth wise, ETH definitely has the potential to skyrocket like no other coin. It has market economics (burn, gas, POS soon, DeFi opportunities) as well as insanely robust and large development ""team"" working on it. Pretty much everything USEFUL in crypto is running off ETH right now, and there are very exciting things coming in the very near future. ETH will have not only first mover advantage for smart contract/dAPPs, but also likely first to have a stress tested fully scalable working product. Combine first mover advantage with the latter, and it's a clear no-brainer to hold.

That being said new people buy BTC. Say what you want, new people for the forseable future will buy BTC. For some people BTC and Crypto are literally the same meaning. 

I remember watching a Joe Rogan podcast a few month ago and someone brought up Ethereum, and he hadn't even heard of it. He was asking ""what's that?"". This is a guy who has known about crypto for years. Obviously not super into it if he never heard of ETH before, but still, the point remains. 99% of people out there have never even heard of Ethereum. But they know Bitcoin.

I would say a rough 50-50 split is a good idea (1:1), but anywhere in the 2:1 to 1:2 ratio is a pretty safe spot. Myself, I'm heavier in ETH, (I'm more in the 2:1 ETH:BTC ratio), but only because I think there's just too much coming up in ETH in the next year or two, and also that it got disproportionally sold off during ICO mania panic selloff. So I think ETH is both oversold and also will absolutely inevitably flip BTC in the future. By future I mean the next TEN YEARS. Not 10 weeks. But long long term, I absolutely see ETH being rank 1, no question in my mind.

For now, I think your ratio is fine.

I also think now is not the time to play with alts (today is a bad day to make that statement, but I stand by it). I think new people come into BTC and to a lesser extent ETH, hold for half a year, and THEN start branching out.  I see the next bullrun as being media-led, i.e. no-coiners will lead the next bull run as they come into this space. So 90% of my portfolio is BTC/ETH.

In 2017 I was 10% BTC, 10% ETH, 80% alts. 2018 I moved into almost 90% BTC, because I considered it the ""gold"" that people would jump to. That worked out well. Today, today, I'm staying roughly the same, 90% BTC/ETH, but myself I'm just heavier in ETH, but I still am 30% BTC in my portfolio, 60% ETH, 10% pet projects.",,2020-02-11 19:21:43,1581445303,,{},fhbmgfn,False,t3_f1znmx,False,True,t1_fhbl9n5,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/f1znmx/daily_discussion_february_11_2020_gmt0/fhbmgfn/,1581445337,1,True,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,0

&gt; &gt;smh, Total daily inflation rate from BTC miners selling is 4.8 times larger than sales of XRP from Ripple.
&gt; 
&gt; Source for this information? I think you are being very misleading...
&gt; 
&gt; **XRP**
&gt; 
&gt; Total XRP amount =  100 Billion
&gt; 
&gt; Total circulating XRP amount =  41 Billion
&gt; 
&gt; Amount waiting to inflate market = 59 Billion
&gt; 
&gt; Amount to be released = 59%
&gt; 
&gt; Highest inflation in a day = 25% = 25 BILLION XRP
&gt; 
&gt; [https://content.invisioncic.com/r263943/monthly\_2019\_02/xrp-price-history.jpg.4b26e540bda0c76450baa47a1549d521.jpg](https://content.invisioncic.com/r263943/monthly_2019_02/xrp-price-history.jpg.4b26e540bda0c76450baa47a1549d521.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; **BTC**
&gt; 
&gt; Total circulating BTC amount =   18.1 Million
&gt; 
&gt; Total BTC amount = 21 million
&gt; 
&gt; Amount waiting to inflate market = 2.9 Million
&gt; 
&gt; Amount to be released = 13%
&gt; 
&gt; Highest inflation in a day = .01% = 7,200 BTC
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; If you consider the fact that 100 billion XRP were printed at creation in a single day, XRP clearly has way more inflation than bitcoin ever had. If you don't accept pre-mined coins as legit, billions of XRP have been released in a single day...
&gt; 
&gt; There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins and they will only be released at a pre determined rate.

&gt; &gt;The money from Ripples XRP sales goes to fund more development. and increases the value and utility of XRP in the long rung

#**Dick Ratings**

I honestly just really love rating dicks and my cock ratings have become one of my most popular services. [Read what other people have had to say about them here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clarabelle_Says/wiki/ratings#wiki_reviews.3A) or take the plunge and order one for yourself! I'm honest and constructive by default and touch on size, shape, grooming, photography skills, cumshot and how compatible we'd be in bed. Make sure to give me your name if you'd like me to use it free of charge and to specify if you'd like an honest or a SPH-themed Femdom cock rating. 

####""BASIC"" KIK COCK RATING - 24h delivery, usually much quicker
**$45** | Short &amp; sweet, ~4 minutes of video sent via kik/Telegram that gives you the Spark Notes version of my longer ratings.

####""GOLD STANDARD"" HD COCK RATING - 72hr delivery
**$85** | Clocking in at 10-15 minutes in length, this video tells you everything you've ever wondered about my thoughts on your cock.

####""EXTRA SEXY"" COCK RATING - 72hr delivery

I frequently make the argument that Bitcoin is centralized within China and that their influence in the space is disproportionate and may be dangerous.

We don't know what's going to happen the next time markets crash. And the way that the Fed is handling situations on a daily basis seems to me like they're trying as hard as they can to keep an imminent collapse from occurring.

During recent financial crises we saw the wealthy move out of fiat and into safe-haven assets like Gold. The less correlation the asset has with other markets, the more attractive it became to those attempting to preserve their wealth. The only asset class in existance which currently has zero (or almost zero) correlation to any other market are crytpocurrencies. 

I'm not saying that this is going to make it explode the next time there's a financial crises in the world. I find it more likely that people still go with what they know has worked in the past. But BTC is just easier to spend, use, transport, hold, etc. than a precious metal. So there's a possibility that BTC could surprise us by increasing in value during a crisis. Like you said, this theory is untested. And I'm actually not too confident about things turning out this way. 

Actually, if central banks noticed mass amounts of their currencies flooding into exchanges they would probably halt all of the transactions. Similar to how the Fed halted all withdrawals after a ""silent"" bank run lead to nearly half a trillion dollars being withdrawn within a few hours. 

But if they hadn't stopped it, the dollar would have been definitively worthless and the global market would have entirely collapsed.

&gt; So perhaps this idea has already been floated, but perhaps it has not. If it hasn't, I do not know if it is feasible, but if it is, I think I've thought of a way to keep almost everyone happy on the sub.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously we get flooded with memes anytime the price moves more than a few percent. Instead of running around picking and choosing what posts will be allowed, and which ones won't, what if we were able to create bot that auto-posted a sticky to the sub with a title like ""Daily Price Action Meme Thread"". The bot would only create the thread on days where there was x% action on the price. Say +-5% or so.
&gt; 
&gt; In that thread, memes are free range. Repeaters, nonsense, all the good stuff. You can post to your heart's content.
&gt; 
&gt; Outside of that thread though, memes are more strictly regulated, and while completely new or novel memes might be allowed in the greater sub, they will be highly scrutinized and removed if they have a whiff of unoriginality.
&gt; 
&gt; Might help everyone focus their meme'ing in a single place, and help keep the sub as a whole a lot cleaner during times of high (relative) price action.",,2020-02-11 17:45:53,1581439553,,{},fhbco7v,True,t3_f2azmr,False,True,t3_f2azmr,/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/f2azmr/uncensoredrbitcoin_daily_discussion_february_11/fhbco7v/,1581439563,1,True,False,noncensored_bitcoin,t5_3nug4,0

Suas afirmações estão certas, realmente ninguém usa Bitcoin para comprar pão. Mas isso é o mesmo que tentar precificar ouro ou ações com base na capacidade que esses ativos tem de comprar pão.
O valor do Bitcoin está em alguns aspectos menos óbvios, mas que fazem sentido se vistos em conjunto: ele é um ativo decentralizado (ninguém emite ou controla), com escassez (número fixo de moedas), relativamente fácil de transacionar e transportar (você faz um envio em minutos para qualquer lugar do mundo), anônimo (é possível verificar todas transações abertamente, mas não é nada fácil identificar o dono de cada conta) e, talvez o mais importante, ele foi a primeira criptomoeda (o efeito rede é assustador, Bitcoin basicamente é sinônimo de uma nova classe de ativos).
O mundo não precisa somente de dinheiro para transacionar (comprar pão e café), na verdade a maior parte do dinheiro existente serve como reserva de valor, e é aí que o Bitcoin vira uma das melhores soluções existentes.
Com o mundo lastreado em moedas nacionais (fiduciárias) de emissão quase irrestrita, precisamos de mais ativos realmente escassos para reserva monetária, porque ninguém quer perder o poder de compra. Ativos escassos tendem a se valorizar com o passar do tempo, ao contrário das moedas, que tendem a historicamente sumir.
Precificar novos ativos dessa natureza é uma tarefa difícil, quase uma novidade para todos, mas o esforço coletivo é bem agitado, como você pode acompanhar no caso do Bitcoin. Especulação não é uma coisa ruim, especular ajuda a precificar.
Muitos podem não compreender ainda, mas a utilidade de algo nem sempre é óbvia. É nesse atraso de compreensão que muitos especuladores ganham dinheiro.
O Bitcoin pode ir a zero? Claro, ninguém sabe ao certo, mas somente por motivos muito mais graves, não será por falta de uso na compra de pão.",,2020-02-11 17:44:22,1581439462,,{},fhbciuc,False,t3_f22ow3,False,True,t1_fhapleu,/r/brasilivre/comments/f22ow3/o_bitcoin_teve_uma_alta_de_40_neste_ano_o_que_vcs/fhbciuc/,1581439473,1,True,False,brasilivre,t5_351wl,0

Personally, the hideout is a profit machine. Between bitcoin, scav case, ammo, mag cases, moonshine you can make 0.8/1mil per day.

My survival rate is 40%, which means that I if I bring 1mil loadout every raid, 4 out of 10 them will be successful, and if I make 1mil on every run I survive I will never lose money. Put into the equation that many loadouts are cheaper, that you can gamma high value loot even if you die and insurance returns, you have basically infinite money. (4mil + 1mil loadout that I keep+insurance + gamma stuff +1mil hideout - 6mil loadouts lost).

The hideout is nice because it is a money sink, but once you finish it you gonna sit on a constant stream of income.

The most amazing thing is that prices are super inflated with respect to previous wipes. In 0.11 M995 was 4$ vendor price. Today it's almost 4 times the price. Many attachments cost 40k instead of 20k, and have been nerfed (rk1 angled grip). These are just examples, but the point is that despite that, you can still make money very very easily.

Hi there! I'm Amelia, a bisexual redhead from Scotland.

In my civillian life, I'm the perfect image of the girl next door. But at night I'm the seductive siren of your dreams and nightmares, and an absolute vixen in the sheets.

Why don't you get yourself on that list and find out why redheads are the most dangerous girls?

*Stats: 5'10"" - 140lbs - Size 10 - EU42 feet - 32A-28-38 - Bush*

On October 23, 2014, [Blockstream goes public](https://blockstream.com/2014/10/23/why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream.html) and announces funding and the formation of their company. Shortly after Blockstream was [incorporated](https://archive.is/qzsVe), they received [$50 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/blockstream-series-unknown--66d2817a#section-investors) in venture capital from AXA, Khosla Ventures, Horizon Ventures, etc., some of the most powerful venture firms in the world. The [Blockstream board of directors](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kflur/anybody_ever_find_anything_interesting_in_these/dre1508/) are all bankers.

In the Summer of 2015, all of the primary Bitcoin communities such as /r/Bitcoin, mailing lists, Bitcoin Talk, wikis, etc., began [massive censorship campaigns](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) against any and all topics that had to do with scaling Bitcoin beyond the 1MB limit which, by the way, was temporarily added by Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2010 as a stop-gap measure to prevent spam in the early days.

When you do your own research, you will find that the Bitcoin name and repository were hijacked by a for-profit organisation so they could make a buck on their own patented and convoluted ""solution"" for a problem that doen't even exist (in fact; they themselves created it). In this process, Bitcoin (BTC) was turned into an altcoin by implementing SegWit (the coin itself is no longer a “chain of digital signatures,” as per Fig. 1 of the white paper).

TLDR: [Blockstream fucked Bitcoin over](https://youtu.be/jctc85X_PCI?t=79) and r/Bitcoin bans people talking about it.

We also know that Ted was hyping us up during that period like nothing is happening in the background. They told us Matts disappearance had nothing to do with it. After the lawsuit became public Ted kept lying by saying they will win and they are very confident and everything is out of context. Knock Knock, we found out it's not.   
The followup was mass layoffs and a tone that was  very negative. He doesn't own us shit was the mantra and there is a video of ted saying this, not only text.   


""Saying another human is an animal, degrades them to the point of becoming subhuman.""  
That's only your view. I actually like and respect animals, my comment history and visited subs act as an confirmation. You don't kill something because it's an animal. It's the year 2020 btw.  Animals have no ethics, at least most of them. (Source: BBC Planet)(Just joking about the source, it's not only BBC xD)   
So now it's a description of no ethics. What you said above is just your own bent view.   


""The KF team is actually doing things to make it a reality. Is it as amazing as it should have been? No. Is there anyone who believes that the SEC oversight has had zero impact????? We all believe that the SEC has caused a negative impact from the lack of 'good' exchanges to rushing the Kin SDK, to lack of funds and downsizing the team. It is currently a sub-par product (compared to the whitepaper) and I hope once this mess is over it should eventually become what they wish it to become. Until then, its going to live on in lifeline mode.""  


The whole point is they lied about their pre conditions. That's also why the SEC is  after them and doesn't want to settle. They are constantly lying and it's the same persons you trust right now. No way this is something that was planned through 2014 and if you read the mythbusters articles, especially the first ones you'll see people who worked on the KIK points and what they have to say.(Head of Engineering or something like this)  
He is a scam artist, they hired kool-aid and they apply nasty tricks like the buybacks. I got banned for exposing Osnats feminism agenda and the best part is she even confirmed it, she said ""Do you have a problem with that""? Fuck yes bitch i do have a problem when funds get abused for personal agendas. ChaseeB banned me for nothing on their Discord, 100% helpfull history, ask one time about the post that chaseeB retweeted(he fucking retweeted the FUD as it would be something valid) and he banned me afterwards, that's how Nazis look like, not the crap you mentioned above. They are totalitarians and you are still drinking the kool-aid that they'll go towards decentralization or that they could ever become net neutral, Bitcoin has value due to this, because that's how a currency should look like. On Kin you have a 75%\~ Whitelisting reserve, a centralized board, a centralized Network and a centralized onboarding. There is also a mythbusters article as to why Kin isn't decentralized.   
Ted is abusing you 24/7/365 and you don't even notice this. I can't write always essays as to why it's a scam there are so many articles in here. Just go through the FAQ as a starting point.   
Lack of funds you say? They raised 100m$ and they copied the code from stellar. How much ICO money did they use for their own rework of KIK ? Do you remember when the whole team was prioritizing this?   
Where did the money from the acquisition go? If they used funds for Kik and they benefited from the sale, then isn't it like we actually had a stake in it too? Who benefited from it? Radio silence about these things and now we have a Kin-Fork called Code.    
   
u/Bryanlahartinger care to confirm that it's mainly nazis alike people working for Kin?  


"" I think if you are SantaAna and are going to spend 20min-1hr writing a long essay-esque piece, it would be more beneficial just to....... Even if you believe the essay is a viable strategy, you still have to deal with thin

.""  


It doesn't have to be a viable strategy as people don't always act smart, not even close to.   


""You also keep calling SantaAna a shill, but wouldn't all devs who are using Kin be considered a shill too?""  


Because this son of a bitch is constantly [manipulating](https://imgur.com/a/wbFKgrz) the market and soon we will analyze his wallet activities. The new KnowYourShill episode about him will also show that he doesn't know how to code, it's all BS and he attacks others [about](https://imgur.com/a/18fJ4UR) it.

Also the promised buyback he promised publicly isn't as he planned it, it's just fake with his own words again. He is also still attacking other Devs in DMs now which means your ""I think he did delete his comments last I checked, so I suppose that means he had a change of heart?"" is wrong, he also says the challenges are rigged.  


Other devs shill their utility not the coin itself and if they shill it they don't build upon lies and they don't sell while claiming they are buying. That's the best path to lose credibility and there is a clear [pattern](https://www.reddit.com/r/KinFoundationTruth/comments/eudgzx/dont_trust_hikers_snake_oil_charm/) on how this looks like. Hiker is doing this now over 1 year. Lose credibility once because of fake shilling and you are done for the outsider.   
Not every dev gets attacked, lul.   


The KF now publishes the app-ids+ wallets to put some responsibility on them but the Royal Kings avoid it like the pest for themselves.   


""Everything checks out to me. Is there something here which is malicious?""  
The malicious part is hyping others to buy to create volume to unload his bag to do it on higher prices. It's called market manipulation with a 100% direct benefit.   
If he did it without the fake shilling and claiming that he is holding strong it would be more than fine.  The same applies to Hikers bs.  


"". it is just too absurd.""  
It might be absurd but the reality is they shouldn't let a volatile emotional person on that position. No judging position at all. Especially not when claiming you are ""decentralized"" || ""censorshipresistant"" to the bones.    


""Decentralization should be occurring soon. They have said it in the past, and even the new SEC news suggested decentralization should be a theme for projects that involve an ICO. They have opened up the KRE 2.0 to revisions via github, so things are slowly moving in that way.  


""Soon TM"". Thy have said in the past a lot of things and almost all of it were lies, they lost all their credibility and it doesn't matter what they say at this point. If you still believe them, then you might be drinking the kool-aid.  


They opened the KRE after i was spamming for months about it while it was heavy raining downvotes on my neck in the main channel. (My language was very polite)

First off - not my first language - sorry for mistakes. 

No idea how many of you known what Bitcoin is. It is like a investment but in a currency format (blockchain based crypto currency). And it has made huge profits in the last years (50c in 2010 to 14k in 2019).

Based on the past performance and the knowledge I have, I invested some cash in it and made good profits. But at first I didn't say anything to anyone. After I explained my profits to them nearly all my friends did say... WTF why didn't you say something?! We would have invested too!

OK, fast forward to mid December last year (2 months ago). The cost of 1 bitcoin was arround 6500 USD and I was sure it will skyrocket in at most 6 months. So I did what they all asked - I called them up with ""Hey now it is the time to buy! But be fast."" but noone did buy anything (as far I know).

Now to last week. The price was at 9200 USD (that is a 45% increase in a little more than 1 month) and I decided to send all our friends who did complain and got my ""buy now"" info a msg with the info they just lost 45%, they could have, if they would have listened. I worded it like: ""Hey did you see the price of BTC is up by 45%?"". 

My wife says I'm an AH becouse I make them feel bad and I couldn't have known it will go up so much. I disagree becouse I have done a ton of research and nearly every financial research shows it will go up much more.

Am I the AH becouse I did send it and I want to send them updates as soon the price goes up again? Just for info not one of them did respond to my msg.

## Suppose Bitcoin were to handle 100K trans/sec, how big would the blocks have to be?

Numbers:

* 250 bytes / trans
* 10 min / block
* 60 sec / min

* 6 block / hour
* 24 hour / day
* 365 day / year

The week includes one 30 min kik session (or it can be split into two 15 minute ones or three 10 minute ones). The 3 day and 1 day options do not include an actual session, but do include the random photos and videos! During any of my options, you get 50% off any other services you want during the week!

The bitcoin project was designed in a way that it could, conceivably, store value if it caught on. That's why things like scarcity and fungibility was built into it. That doesn't mean it was destined to succeed at storing value, simply because it was designed to be able to. You still need participants and a market. But at least it started with a good framework. Bear with me.

With no real market or valuation in the early days, it didn't exactly store value in any meaningful sense. But because the groundwork had been laid, people saw an opportunity to buy as a means of speculation. This speculation was essentially self-fulfilling - it became profitable because other people were speculating. That's how bubbles work. We've seen 3 distinct ones.

However, keep in mind these aren't beanie babies. Yes speculation fueled things to get to this point, but look at where we are now. Maybe you aren't personally finding a usefulness for holding and transferring bitcoins - but I can assure you that many individuals are. And they tend to be on the wealthier side.

Whether you like it or not, it has slowly been developing into a unique asset that many people are discovering is functional to them for various reasons. Is it perfect for everyone? No, but it doesn't need to be. That's why we have many different assets, currencies, commodities. Bitcoin just happens to be another one. It is evolving not towards what people want it to be, but what it excels at. Storing and moving large amounts of value in a decentralized manner.

I don't think you're dumb. If I did I probably wouldn't have replied at all. I just think you're being stubborn. So to address your question directly:

&gt; how speculative-investing alone will EVER create a \*stable\* BTC 

It won't. What speculative investing has created however is exposure, capital for development, and a large network of participants. Speculating has taken it from nothing to something. It did (and is still doing) exactly what it was supposed to do for all parties involved. People speculated with their capital thinking down the road, the network would be further fleshed out and valuable. It is not so unlike any publicly-traded startup with negative profits but rising stock price from speculation.

You can't deny that it's a lot more useful today than it was in 2011. Again, maybe you aren't someone who actually sees the point in holding bitcoin besides to get explosive gains. But there are plenty of people who are already starting to consider it legitimate enough to be a part of their broader portfolio. Because of it's unique decentralized and psuedo-anonymous properties, it represents potential diversification and hedges that many want exposure to.

I simply feel you aren't viewing it with an open-mind to understand where it is now and why. You want it to have a stable price and have widespread adoption, but in the same breath are treating speculation as completely pointless. How is it supposed to get from A to Z without steps B, C, D... in the meanwhile?

It will never be completely stable because the world is never completely stable. But as it develops further, the speculative upside goes down. As speculation goes down, volatility goes down as the price begins to represent more what the value of the network actually is rather than what it could potentially be. In the beginning it was very exciting but not particularly useful. In the end, it may become not particularly exciting but very useful.

We now know that the SEC has been investigating them since the ICO launch, and started to ask for documents around the time of the ORBS decision.  I am sure that put pressure on them to launch ASAP, which is why they went from ETH, ORBS, Stellar, Stellar-Fork. 

&gt;You can't be serious about it.There is not even an US in my words.... so what exactly do you try to prove here?

Saying another human is an animal, degrades them to the point of becoming subhuman.  Its the standard MO of the regimes I mentioned to allow their side to kill the other side without guilt.  Who could have guessed that humans feel bad and experience sadness and guilt upon killing others and thus, become less effective as a whole.  When they found out that they could make the other side be viewed as animals, it turns out that morale went up and those nasty side effects never kicked in.  The US vs. THEM was implied in your comments.

&gt;Another difference is, we prevent people of buying a SCAM from someone who's deceiving them with lies.It's different having a goal to prevent people from scams from actively just trying to push the price to zero. The first one can have the zero effect but it doesn't mean that this was the purpose of it. Was i clear enough now? (those are also just a few examples and don't cover everything)

The KF team is actually doing things to make it a reality.  Is it as amazing as it should have been? No.  Is there anyone who believes that the SEC oversight has had zero impact?????  We all believe that the SEC has caused a negative impact from the lack of 'good' exchanges to rushing the Kin SDK, to lack of funds and downsizing the team.  It is currently a sub-par product (compared to the whitepaper) and I hope once this mess is over it should eventually become what they wish it to become.  Until then, its going to live on in lifeline mode.

&gt;I agree, it doesn't matter and that's what i told him in DMs too, but he walks around pretending to be a Dev, he even attacked other Devs apps while he put 0 effort to make one.

Im glade we agree on the clone portion.  When you say he attacked other devs, I saw that too and disapproved of it.  Kin devs should work together and not create divisiveness between them.  Thats the whole idea of Kin that the ecosystem is stronger together with a cheap universal currency.  I think he did delete his comments last I checked, so I suppose that means he had a change of heart?

&gt;He says he'll implement Ads to sustain and he will use that money to buy Kin.

I read that too, but it included, and i'm going to be polite here 'rambling', and it was hard to fully understand what his goal was.  Something about using ads to buy kin to give that extra kin to users or something? Im not entirely sure.

&gt;Now people get hyped but what they don't know is that he was lying all along to get more users

I disagree on that.  I think if you are SantaAna and are going to spend 20min-1hr writing a long essay-esque piece, it would be more beneficial just to pay for mobile ads as your guaranteed to get users vs. hoping to '*trick*' readers into becoming players as you suggest.  Even if you believe the essay is a viable strategy, you still have to deal with things like churn and retention.  I imagine it would provide negligible returns and like most Reddit posts, never be seen again once its 24 hours old.

You also keep calling SantaAna a shill, but wouldn't all devs who are using Kin be considered a shill too?  They all want the same thing, for Kin to grow in price and usage (preferably in their apps).  I don't see a problem with them making the ecosystem stronger through apps or by being a regular member of the community.

&gt;Buiftch said this shill was sending his Kin to exchanges as soon as he got it and i'll try to validate that as soon as my node is fully synced which could take ages compared with stellars version

I never intentionally looked into this, but I did come across it awhile ago and Buiftch appears to be accurate.  It surprised me too, so I looked into it and found some posts where he says he needs to pay for advertising and also is making a v2 of the game, so that would align with his need of selling Kin to fund advertising and development.  Everything checks out to me. Is there something here which is malicious?

I also never looked into Hiker's app and have no reason to.  Again, is there something here which is malicious?

&gt;They apply very sensitive the rules upon us and to those who are critical, especially in the past, but if the rules really applied in a neutral fashion to everyone 90% of the sub would be banned just because of rule nr.2

I've not noticed this, so I cannot comment.

Kevin flaws, I think your trying to frame Ted with that 'big brain' meme by choosing Kevin as the moderator.  That seems highly unlikely for several reasons.  One, how would Ted know about his medical history, as thats not something that asked on job applications/interviews.  Two, even in the event of filing FMLA only the HR director would know and its not allowed to be discussed outside of that per HIPPA laws.  Three, why am I even entertaining this as a possibility... it is just too absurd.

&gt;That means Kin has no value. It's a centralized coin, run by tyrants and they are clearly not net neutral. Bitcoin is at 10k because it's decentralized and neutral to everyone.

Decentralization should be occurring soon.  They have said it in the past, and even the new SEC news suggested decentralization should be a theme for projects that involve an ICO.  They have opened up the KRE 2.0 to revisions via github, so things are slowly moving in that way.",,2020-02-11 15:44:49,1581432289,,{},fhb1059,False,t3_eyrq1a,False,True,t1_fh6yyme,/r/KinFoundationTruth/comments/eyrq1a/thank_you_buiftch/fhb1059/,1581432290,1,True,False,KinFoundationTruth,t5_25i0bz,0

Yesterday, **I** **fucked a cow.** I have to admit, it was pretty nice, but I now realize that a CCTV-camera was recording the entire session. I have reached out to the farmer who leased me the cow, but he was black. So no further interactions were made after that revelation, obviously.

Unfortunately, my dick did not perform well, which worries me since it has never let me down before. In addition, I'm worried that I haven't fulfilled my sexual duties by satisfying the beautiful, tight, animal. My dick is also purple. I am disappointed because I paid quite a lot for the 40-minute session. I would like a full refund, but the transaction has already gone through. Also, this might seem illegal and that it would be appropriate to file a police report, but I'm afraid the general public won't be on my side. However, I can assure you the cow is feeling well and that the vet claims to be expecting a full recovery.

Furthermore, is it ethical to eat the cow that I had sex with? After having paid for the session, my bank account is on the lower end of the spectrum, leaving me with little leeway for spontaneous purchases or even food. I'm hungry, sad, possibly have several STDs and a purple dick. Besides, the farmer has threatened to release the tape demanding a ransom of $250,000 (something I cannot afford, but I plan to bargain), which is why I'm once again asking for your **financial support.**

To resolve the problem, please consider donating any amount in bitcoin to my address: ""1x3ug2KtKgiw86d7wviMZU5LL6s1e2JgP"". I would appreciate any efforts to spread awareness of my current critical situation or financial contributions. For inquiries, please reach out to me via Direct Message here on Reddit.

&gt;Arguably looking to Dark Net Markets is a leading indicator of “potential value”. Don’t forget where Bitcoin was initially heavily used and emerged from.. and is still used.

Indeed, for enthusiasts. For the public/business/industry any Dark Net association is a big no-no and red flag

&gt;If criminals aren’t bothered using your “currency” to their advantage.. then it’s flawed. This speaks volumes for Monero.

It's more about which is a better vehicle for criminality. An unregulated, private, untraceable currency is generally a better vehicle for fraud, laundering, illicit use, bribery than a traceable one

&gt;Regulatory acceptance whilst on the top layer may keep some “investors” away and also some Exchanges from listing it due to “uncertainty” it is most definitely not enough to crush Monero.

&gt;If it gets sent underground it will just become more rare and therefore quite possibly more “valuable”. If it’s harder to obtain certain members of society will still absolutely want it. But that won’t happen anyway.

At any point in time global or national regulators could forbid banks/payment services from doing business with crypto exchanges that e.g. carried particular coins. If you've seen what happens to a coin when a major exchange drops it, then you can probably imagine the impact on price if all exchanges dropped it. 

&gt;If I gave you a $100 bill do you know where it’s been spent in the past? Exactly. It’s none of your business nor a “need to know”.

I don't need to know, but any financial services I use are typically responsible for performing checks on the cash

&gt;Bitcoin is MORE like an Asset and Monero is MORE like Cash.

They are pretty much the same, both are assets *that can be used as a type of money.* Money and currency are different things. Due to their structural volatility, they are both unsuitable as modern currencies.

If the situation is exactly as you described then yes, but as you have access to that seed you might as well check it for peace of mind. Stranger things have happened, best to cover all bases.

&gt; I have never updated the ledger or installed ledger live in fear of losing everything. 

Nothing (i.e. your bitcoin) is stored solely on the ledger; as long as you have the 24 word seed, your coins are always recoverable to any other device.

&gt;  Is is still possible to use the Nano S without Ledger Live? 

Possible, but I'm not certain. Why would you need to do this? I can't think of a reason to use/attempt to use the old Chrome apps.

&gt; I have never set up any passphrase with the ledger - just the 24 word seed and my PIN number only. 

Recoveryof your bitcoin wallet is as simple as punching in your 24 word seed in that case!

&gt; Someone I recently spoke with seems to think that the 36ez BTC Segwit address that my Ledger gave me and where the coins are still sitting is actually a LTC address and that it needs to be converted? Yet when I tried this option - it never brought up the 36ez address?! 

This is testing my memory but iirc Litecoin went through an address format change a couple of years ago. You can use a tool like this one  [https://litecoin-project.github.io/p2sh-convert/](https://litecoin-project.github.io/p2sh-convert/)  to translate an old LTC address format to the newer address format. But this is Litecoin and we're talking about bitcoin, so unless your friend sent your bitcoin to a Litecoin address, this is info pretty irrelevant regarding your predicament. 

As your lost bitcoin address starts with a ""3"" it is a Nested SegWit address - these are supported in Ledger no problem and are one of the two default address options that show up.",,2020-02-11 15:12:20,1581430340,,{},fhayar9,False,t3_f1ouo4,False,True,t1_fhaxpdo,/r/ledgerwallet/comments/f1ouo4/ledger_nano_s_expert_required/fhayar9/,1581430342,1,True,False,ledgerwallet,t5_35ity,0

If criminals aren’t bothered using your “currency” to their advantage.. then it’s flawed. This speaks volumes for Monero.

Regulatory acceptance whilst on the top layer may keep some “investors” away and also some Exchanges from listing it due to “uncertainty” it is most definitely not enough to crush Monero. 

If it gets sent underground it will just become more rare and therefore quite possibly more “valuable”.  It’s harder to obtain certain members of society will still absolutely want it. But that won’t happen anyway.

The argument flows both ways.

There’s a View Key which is basically a read only option for your wallet.. so it is “audit-able” for law enforcement or taxation purposes.

It’s the closest crypto to actual cash there is.

If I gave you a $100 bill do you know where it’s been spent in the past? Exactly. It’s none of your business nor a “need to know”. An opaque ledger gives true fungibility also.

Being disinflationary rather than deflationary is also a good thing rather than “hard capped” like Bitcoin and co. Is cash hard capped?

&gt;Nano has better store of value properties than Bitcoin. Zero inflation, fully distributed, much less energy and capex required to maintain the network, greater divisibility, zero fees, etc. It just happens to also be usable day-to-day

Indeed, but Nano hyper-inflates and deflates on a regular basis. It's moved 20% in a week, 60% in a month, that's because by definition it's a speculative asset, not a currency

&gt;And volatility DOES decrease with higher volume and higher market caps.

I agree, but it's crucial to point out that it decreases only SOMEWHAT. But as we know, BTC hit a very high volume and caps in 2017, by crude measures it was the eighth largest ""currency"" in the world, yet it was highly volatile. 

In stark contrast, modern currencies are stable right out of the gate, they don't need a time period or ""scale"" to achieve relative stability

&gt; Besides that, volatility is inherently less of an issue with Nano because of how fast it is.

Simply holding Nano is highly risky (-97% in 9 months). Quickly converting from fiat to Nano to payment to Nano to fiat might be fast but it's a pointless hurdle when the user can just pay in fiat without the added exchange risk (especially for large sums)

The speed of Nano for potential cross-border movements is one of it's strong  points, but that's a crowded field, and there are bank systems like TIPS being trialed that can move cash in seconds with tiny fees. With no risk, all fully insured and covered - with recourse.

We can pay for almost anything, in seconds, accepted everywhere, has insurance, recourse, can be used physically, protection from risk/fraud, prices are relatively stable, full infrastructure in place. 

Nano (and most cryptos) don't compete in that sphere at all.

Many on Reddit have shown their desire to support it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/esbznr/ccs_proposal_locha_mesh_private_transactions_and/

Full Text of the Proposal: 


**What**
Advance the development of the Locha Mesh open-source software and hardware (https://github.com/btcven/locha) to enable private transactions broadcasting and sync without Internet over a resilient decentralized censorship-resistant mesh network using encrypted long-range radio communications.


**Who &amp; Why**
I’m Randy Brito, the founder of http://BitcoinVenezuela.com and co-founder CEO of Locha Mesh (@Locha_io).

At Locha Mesh we are creating the open-source software and hardware for real mesh network devices that will enable secure and private communications and transactions without Internet. The Locha Mesh will also enable access to censorship-resistant websites and information, without people having to post their Internet IP address or SIM card which is linked to their identity, so communications could be completely private.

The firmware that runs on the hardware, the hardware specification itself for creating your DIY Locha Mesh device, the mobile app and other software can be found in our GitHub organization, hosted by the non-profit Bitcoin Venezuela (https://github.com/btcven).

**What we've been doing at Bitcoin Venezuela for Monero over the years:**
- I've recommended the use of Monero in Venezuela for years due to its privacy features.
- Bitcoin Venezuela's prices API have been showing the real market XMRVEF rate for years (used by CakeWallet). Latest version 2.0 has also been showing XMRVES and keeping historical of both (https://api.bitcoinvenezuela.com/v2/historical/?pair=XMRVEF).
- I own MoneroVenezuela.com and MoneroVenezuela.org since 2016 to keep these domain names away from scammers trying to steal from Venezuelans.


**How does the Locha Mesh help Monero?**
We are creating the software and hardware (our own boards and also the specification for a DIY version of it) for anyone to be able to connect to the Locha Mesh to transmit data securely and privately. So the Locha Mesh will enable what we intend to be an alternative communication channel for syncing nodes without having to go through the over-controlled censorable traditional Internet infrastructure.

In the past two years people have tried to transmit Bitcoin transactions over long-range radio, but they've been using hardware that is very limited, closed-source, and also on licensed bands that need the operator to get a Government license to be able to transmit. We at Locha Mesh are creating a real high-bandwidth open mesh network, using license-free bands, that is capable of handling not only block headers and transactions (which are very small in size) but also block sync and other more useful features, like the IPv6 support so services can run inside the Locha Mesh.


**This Proposal and Milestones**
Monthly pay: 50 xmr (or ~$3,500.00 USD)
This monthly pay covers the cost of two full-time developers working on the Locha Mesh core code.
Total: 150 XMR

**Milestones:**
- Improve documentation for Monero developers who want to contribute to Locha Mesh code (first month).
- Improve documentation on how to build a DIY version of the Locha Mesh devices for developers to join efforts (1-2 months).
- Monero will be mentioned in the backers sections at https://github.com/btcven/locha home of the Locha Mesh open-source project, also at the documentation website when it is published, and whenever opportunities arise on social media (1-2 months).
- Work with Monero Outreach to promote Locha Mesh and the support from Monero, as well as translate documentation into other languages (3 months).
- Demo of the Turpial devices sending messages over a radio mesh network (3 months).
Payments: 3 payments of 50 XMR (or ~$3,500.00 USD), one for each month (paid in XMR)

This proposal can be reviewed in a month by month basis, and terminated at any given month if the Monero community agrees on that.

**In the long term**
When previous milestones have been achieved and thanks to the contributions of the Monero community we would have been able to get closer to a deployment-ready state, these are some of the tasks we could work on that could be added in future proposals.

**Future Roadmap:**
- Research of what would be needed to be able to submit_transaction of an off-line signed_monero_tx file using gateways to reach the Monero network
- Details of the finished revision of the Turpial hardware that will be the production-ready device
- The Locha Mesh working as a production-ready product for private messaging over a decentralized mesh network of long-range radio devices
- The implementation of submit_transaction of an off-line signed_monero_tx file using Turpial devices or DIY versions to reach gateways in the Locha Mesh
- Synchronizing a Monero node over the Locha Mesh
- Open-sourcing the hardware of the Turpial device. We could do this, but it would need a substantial amount so we are able to cover the costs of the ongoing development of the Locha Mesh for a couple years at least, if raised development of both the software and hardware would not need to depend on VC money

**Where to follow progress**
Regular updates will be shared by myself /u/rdymac and the development team (changelogs) with features that have been finished and worked on each month (at least monthly) in our Twitter: @Locha_io , the updates section at GitHub (https://github.com/btcven/locha) with the Locha Mesh's core features being implemented, and our website: https://locha.io

I don't know if its paid bots, or delusional fanboys who can't help themselves giving an imaginary blowjob to all-mighty Nikita, but the sentiment is both pathetic and sad.

Sadly, this is the attitude alot of people on the sub have, criticism that is fair and good and is listened too can only be beneficial for the community and game as a whole. Sadly though, it seems like people that *really* shouldn't have this attitude do, and the community suffers for it.

&gt;Don't stop criticizing. Do it properly, do it thoroughly, but don't stop. You're not hurting anyone by voicing a valid concern.

Yes

&gt;Nikita seem to be a huge fan of aggressive monetization techniques. Their previous project was straight up P2W bullshit, with paid services like clan system tackled on top. Tarkov has a retail price tag, with EOD premium version that for all intends and purposes is a soft P2W. (And again, before you reply with ""GiT GuD! iTs nOt P2w!"", fuck right off and educate yourself on definition of P2W in games. Economic advantage is still an advantage, it has direct gameplay implications in EFT, and it's purchasable with cash) Premium version of EFT are designed to create a visible discomfort for non-paying user leaving enough room for premium users to keep repeating ""but it won't win you the firefight"". It's merely a middle ground between providing a direct advantage in a firefight for money, and just selling cosmetics or fluff features. In this case I find degree of the issue absolutely irrelevant. The game is ether free of P2W elements, or its P2W;

I've said this multiple times, and been downvoted to shit for it. EOD does not give you an advantage in a direct firefight, your bullets will not do more damage, your armor will not absorb more bullets. BUT not only will you be able to stick more shit in your container, you are able to keep more meds, keys, bullets, things that 100% affect gameplay, but you can also use these things to make more money.

Take a standard user for example, 2x2, 4 slots. Most will probably have a SICC case for keys or a Keybar and Docs case. That leaves 1-2 slots free, most valuable items (With the exception of keys, bitcoin, GP coins, and LedX) are 1x2. Not small enough to fit in a 2x2. Now take a Gamma, a 3x3 container, you can fit meds, spare ammo, keys, money, everything you could possibly need in a raid, and STILL have room to spare for valuable items. Ever wonder why you sometimes find players with a GPU in their bag? Its because they couldn't fit it in their Alpha container.

A really good example of the advantages this gives you are meds, a standard user cannot fit a survival kit in their case whatsoever, a CMS maybe, but a survival kit? No. This means if an AI scav goes sicko mode on your leg with a shotgun from 300+ meters away and blacks and fractures it. You have 2 options.

1. Heal your blacked leg with your CMS, and hope to god you brought a splint with you. If not? Fuck your leg. When they nerfed the CMS kit they fucked standard users with a CMS in their alpha, unknowingly or not, idk.

2. Use your painkillers and hobble out of the raid.

Meanwhile EOD can have a survival kit and Iburprofen, which automatically eliminates their need to bring a splint or risk hobbling on one leg for the rest of the raid.

""But I did it to support the devs.""

1. I don't claim anything about what CSW cares about. If you read what I wrote, I was asking whether that's what you thought it was about, because it certainly doesn't seem like it to me.

2. Claiming you are X and caring whether some basement computer nerds believe you are almost certainly two different things.

What it is though, is a masterful marketing strategy. Whether you believe him or not, everyone is talking and writing about it.

&gt; Any rational person should ask why he doesn't instead just spend a few minutes to moves some coins from a Satoshi address and sign a message identifying himself.

I agree, though I would say that any half intelligent person should have figured it out by now. There's two possibilities. He either can't or he doesn't GAF. I know which option you would lean towards, and that's entirely your prerogative.

&gt; because he presumably ""doesn't care"" what anyone else in the community thinks.

Define ""community"" and then explain why it matters.

&gt; Which is it? Does he care or does he not care?

False dichotomy, as already illustrated. 

&gt; With respect to him selling holdings of coins he considers knock-offs or copies (if he actually had them) and maybe using some of those funds to buy into the one coin he says is the True Bitcoin, that would not be ""market manipulation"". That would be the free market: supply and demand having effect on market valuations. He could even do it gradually

Pay to Win, by definition is paying money to have advantages over other players. The main advantages of EOD are gamma, trader rep on start, cash on start and stash size.

Gamma is probably the biggest one as you can cram more; tetris, bitcoin, graphics cards, meds, ect in your ass than a lowly standard player. Trader rep helps a tonne with unlocking early items as less quests have to get done. Stash size is pretty obvious to me, you can store more shit which saves you having to buy shit. It costs a standard player 3m rub, not including buying the parts off flee market to upgrade the stash.

No major pool has taken it up though. It would require the miner to run a node so that they can form their own blocks. 

I think in time a miner will be integrated into the GUI that uses the self-template pooled approach, and we'll start seeing a shift. 

Besides that, no ones come up with a great solution to the centralized pooled mining problem. Not in the 6 years of monero existence, or the 10 years of bitcoin existence. Everyone just waves it away with the ""well the pools are made up of individual miners"" which for Monero is more or less true. I'm not sure of the user flexibility of bitcoin pools. 

I mean, the primary behavior would be for someone to notice a pool is not behaving nicely, and then they announce it on Monero's social channels. And then miners would move their hashrate to a different pool, thus decreasing the hash power of that nefarious pool.

You've just told the internet you've got at least £21k in BTC. I'd be suspicious of anyone wanting to meet you - they may come with a wrench and a buddy.

Your old posts seem a tad all over the place, I think you need to create a list of things to try out and literally tick them off one by one (even if you believe you've done it before, confirming it actually isn't working is a wise idea).

To clarify, your ledger PIN is irrelevant in terms of recovering your funds - the PIN is to protect the device if it is stolen and someone physically messes with it. In basic terms, your 24 word mnemonic translates to a private key string that can be imported into a reset ledger or any other wallet you fancy that supports BIP39 seeds. There are tools to convert the 24 word string to a hexadecimal, but you needn't bother with that yet.

I'd suggest approaching things from a top down view. Start basic, work up. The more complex stuff is not worth getting into if you've not tried the simplest steps and tried them correctly.

You said in previous posts that you have two sets of your seed words and you've never set a passphrase on either. This makes recovery very simple if this is accurate - if you set a passphrase without realising you can employ some logic to try and figure it out (perhaps your passphrase is a commonly used PIN etc). 

Things I'd try first before bothering getting technical:

1. Recover to both sets of seed words. This is easily done by resetting the ledger and choosing the option to recover using seed words  [https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005434914-Restore-from-recovery-phrase](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005434914-Restore-from-recovery-phrase) 
   1. Verify that your firmware is up to date.
   2. Ensure you're running the latest version of ledger live.
   3. Delete and reinstall the bitcoin app on the device.
2. Consider that you may have accidentally set your passphrase as a PIN. This can easily be tested - when you've got your first set of seed words recovered into the device hop onto the passphrase set up and use option 2 to set a temporary passphrase. When prompted for the passphrase, put in a PIN you think is linked to that account. Reload the apps, check the balances. When you unplug the ledger, this passphrase is lost from ledger memory. See this for how to do this:  [https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-passphrase-security](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-passphrase-security) 
   1. Try the same process for the second set of seed words you had. Set the temporary passphrase and type a PIN you may have used into this field.

If those above all fail you can get more technical and go down the rabbit hole, but I wouldn't bother until you're certain that the basics are not helping. 

If those above work, let me know and you can send me some BTC as a thank you.",,2020-02-11 12:40:39,1581421239,,{},fhaor4h,False,t3_f1ouo4,False,True,t3_f1ouo4,/r/ledgerwallet/comments/f1ouo4/ledger_nano_s_expert_required/fhaor4h/,1581421240,1,True,False,ledgerwallet,t5_35ity,0

##Premium Snapchat Subscription


This gives you access to my Premium Snap story. This may include: photos and videos of me nude, teasing, public exposure, day to day updates, premium only sales, and more! I have been having a great and wild time, and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day, for over a year and a half! For premium subscribers (and only at my discretion) I will open content sent to me, although I may not always respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

**SCREENSHOTS are NOT permitted on either the free or premium story!**

Subscription|Price
:--|:-:
1 Month|$30
3 Months|$60
12 Months|$90

-----

##Skype Shows

**All Skype shows MUST be reserved and paid for at least 24 hours in advance**

It's been a while since I offered cam shows, but for a limited time only I will be available for live cam shows done over Skype!!!! Each show is subject to individual pricing, but the general pricing is as follows:


* Clothed chat - $5/min
* Topless JOI - $6/min
* Nude JOI - $8/min
* Nude JOI /w pussy play - $10/min

* Voyeur/Hidden Cam/Ignoring Fetish $4+/min
* Fetish/Domme/Roleplay - $7+/min

If you're interested in setting up a show please PM me with the type of show you're looking for, the desired length, when you would like to do the show, and which payment method you intend to use. In order to setup the show in a timely manner it is important that you send **ALL** of the required information. 

**All Skype shows must be a minimum of 15 minutes!**

--------------

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! 😉

###All kik sessions MUST be a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure we have enough time to have fun 

----

##Cock &amp; Cumshot Ratings

###Options for Cock Ratings :

Rate|Price
:--|:-:
Text|$15 
Clothed via Kik|$30

Nude Video with pussy play via Kik|$80

###Cumshot Ratings (In addition to cock rating):

All ratings vary in length depending on how much I have to say but will include a 1-10 rating as well as a detailed review about its appearance, what I would do with it, and my overall satisfaction. Ratings are not intended to be interactive so please refrain from making any requests. I do not provide any pics/vids to help you get ready for your rate but I encourage you to check out r/LaineyLove to get yourself rock hard 😉

**Types of GFE available**

* Sugaring Arrangements (donation first ; see /r/sugarbaby)

Pricing

GFE|Rate|Description
:--|:--|:--
Low Interaction|$50/day, $250/week|This is my more affordable option. We will have light chat throughout the day periodically but you will be understanding that I'm often busy and I may take a little bit to reply. This is a relaxed arrangement without a whole lot of back in forth. Just a few check-ins a day and some occasional light chat.
Medium Interaction|$75-150/day|This is a middle of the road option where we talk as I'm available. You will occasionally receive photos with this option. With this option I am open to receiving any pictures of yourself you'd like to send including NSFW ones and will be more open to NSFW questions. 
High Interaction|$150+/day|This is a very involved GFE where I interact with you at a similar level to a significant other. Chat will be constant throughout the day unless I have matters to deal with or I am sleeping. I will reply as much as I possibly can. You will receive a mixture of live and gallery photos throughout the duration of the GFE because I love to show off for you!

Like many others, I was really looking forward to Reforged. Perhaps with a few long requested features and improvements in the editor and optimizations in the game (Blizz, those memory leaks were ridiculous. Also, can I finally get the price of an item in triggers?), maybe I could ""reforge"" my own old maps and release them out into the wild.

Needless to say, that's not going to happen. First off, the changes that the editor and the game desperately needed aren't there. That itself wouldn't be too bad, we had means and ways around the idiocies of the old editor and game, after all. But, the EULA simply took the cake for me.

It's not so much that I ever expected to make money from my maps. I didn't then and don't think I could now (though back then, you didn't have Patreon or Bitcoin). For me, it's just about principle. Yes, Blizzard owns the assets, game, world editor, etc. But they don't own my labor. And believe me, making a map that people will enjoy takes a metric ton of work. Why would I work for Blizzard for free? With this EULA, it means I could neve try to make my own game in e.g. Unity based on an idea I tried out in Warcraft 3, cause Blizzard could sue me.

Others have said this before, but imagine if Microsoft called J.K.Rowling and told her they own Harry Potter now, since she wrote the thing in Word. Microsoft also owns the assets used to create it, after all (The Word interface, spellcheck, interface, etc.). It would still be considered ridiculous. And it's just as ridiculous here.

All the other former mapmakers I know feel the same way and refuse to invest any time into this.

Other websites I can recommend:

https://ethanvanderbuilt.com/2014/06/17/top-10-scam-buster-sites/

One of my faves from the above list is:

https://behindmlm.com/

behindmlm covers a *lot* of outright scams. There are pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes, but mostly hybrids of both, with a Ponzi system for payout and an MLM structure for recruiting victims. They often have pretend ""bots"" supposedly mining BitCoin or arbitrage trading cryptocurrency or Forex, with outrageous guaranteed rates of return. You see a lot of shady players popping up over and over again; it's at once fascinating and alarming how long these people avoid jail while hopping from one scam to the next.

I'll close with a Yank/Aussie story. There's a website called rifftrax.com that sells videos of short films and b-movies that they tell jokes over (it's the same crew that did Mystery Science Theater 3000 on the SciFi channel, as it was then known). They did one Aussie short film called *Don't Be a Bloody Idiot*, in which a bearded host (""it's Crocodile Brigham Young!"") talked about the importance of safety ""when you go bush."" Now, he was talking about hiking trips, but in the US, ""bush"" is slang for female pubic hair. Naturally, the jokesters had fun with that, but it got even better when he started talking about lone hunters as ""shooters in the bush."" I'm sure I don't need to elaborate on where our filthy Yank minds went when we heard that phrase. Other highlights included Warner Bros.' Tasmanian Devil noises when the Tasmania police station was on the screen, and shouts of despair when a small pocketknife was shown as being ideal (""Make up your mind, Australia!"").

If something I've said was not factual it would be easy to disprove. If you need more details on something because you don't believe it to be true then ask (or do some research).

I'm also not making wrong assumptions, what's happening on BSV has already happened on BCH at a smaller scale during that so-called stresstest on mainnet, nodes were dropping like flies.

You're trying to find excuses for BCH developers when these things are exactly what Bitcoin developers predicted would happen with larger blocks. It didn't have major consequences when it happened on BCH because almost nobody uses it (blocks are almost empty).

If for example [those issues](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-bitcoin-cash-hardfork-three-interrelated-incidents/) (among many others) happened on Bitcoin it would have been a major hit in people's confidence of the reliability of the coin. Much more than few days with higher fees.

&gt; duh, yeah they are idiots and a cult. no comparison.

That's not a counter-argument at all, we're talking about the settings of the chain. BCH has the same delusion of grandeur and planned Terabyte/unlimited sized blocks in a near future as per the centralized ""roadmap"" of the most used node implementation. You're calling them idiots when you have the same plans.

&gt; there was wide agreement among miners and business ecosystem to increase blocksize. that is well documented.

Where are they now? As the saying goes, to promise and give nothing is comfort to a fool. It's well documented that they didn't choose BCH's proposition although having it as an option within a couple of week after SegWit's softfork on Bitcoin. They had the same funds available since you guys have chosen to use Bitcoin's historical data... They didn't switch then, they won't switch two and a half year latter.

If you haven't noticed the downward pressure on the price since that fork, almost everyone has sold their airdropped coins, it represents barely 4% of the price of Bitcoin now.

&gt; real-life experience of the btc network becoming functionally broken with full blocks

It was not ""functionally broken"", because low fees isn't a functionality. It's a benefit we have when the system isn't running over capacity. This capacity is dictated by the physical constraints we have to deal with to keep the network decentralized. If most of your miners/nodes drop because they can't synchronize with your shiny 1TB blocks every 10 minutes suddenly that can preserve low fees forever, you network will be taken over really quickly.

&gt; and to see prominent btc devs pronounce a broken network to be working as intended doesn't really inspire confidence in the future of that chain.

If people don't want to acknowledge the real physical constraints of this technology and can't appreciate the efforts being done to push forward, you don't just ignore theses constraints and give them what they want now. That's how you end up with actually broken systems that will fold as soon as the new capacity is used... as demonstrated with BCH's failed stresstests and how BSV ""works"" (it doesn't).",,2020-02-11 09:49:22,1581410962,,{},fhahlts,False,t3_f1mbzy,False,True,t1_fh9rewc,/r/btc/comments/f1mbzy/main_pos_in_thailand_disables_btc_payments_as/fhahlts/,1581410964,1,True,False,btc,t5_2si5v,0

No, we don't need a very high of nodes, eventually nodes will be miners only, and some specialised businesses, like those that will store all the data and specialise in that aspect of Bitcoin, will have their own nodes also, I bet governments will have them also, SPV will make nodes work the way they are intended, not needing to store whole blockchain, so don't worry about the nodes % there, they are just a marketing gimmick for BTC.",,2020-02-11 09:39:44,1581410384,,{},fhah6su,False,t3_f22jwo,False,True,t1_fha4s3j,/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/f22jwo/finally_bsv_hash_rate_surpass_bch_on_02102020/fhah6su/,1581410385,1,True,False,bitcoincashSV,t5_qzksz,0

That’s because this sub was created many years before Bitcoin Cash ever existed. 

This sub was created because r/bitcoin started aggressively censoring posts, deleting posts, banning users, hiding the sort order of comments, hiding their moderator logs, and many other nefarious &amp; evil things — all to silence anyone who wanted to see the original Bitcoin project succeed as P2P cash. Anybody who wanted the block size limit increased was banned or censored or deleted. Anybody who questioned their official narrative was banned or censored or deleted. 

And all of this evilness still happens to this day.

So this sub (r/btc) was created to be censorship-free, where anybody could speak their mind about raising the blocksize (or any other bitcoin-related topic). The blocksize increase finally happened with Bitcoin Cash, because Core devs never budged on their insane positions that went completely against the whole goal of bitcoin: to bring P2P electronic cash to the world.

So this subreddit naturally started supporting Bitcoin Cash. We would’ve supported Bitcoin if they had kept the original project alive... but they killed it.

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! 😉

###All kik sessions MUST be a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure we have enough time to have fun

But let's examine it more in depth, shall we? Oh and remember that this applies pretty much to most cryptocurrency communities. And I've ventured to and read a lot in quite and few.

From a cult education institute. Ten warning signs of a potentially unsafe group/leader.

&gt;Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.

Freedom loving mods in r/bitcoin admitted they're not interested in freedom and they are happy to ban even 90% of their sub population if they won't adhere to the party line. But it is not unique to that sub, most crypto subs are tightly moderated echo chambers with borderline nazi mods (proverbially, not literally) with zero accountability or transparency.

&gt;No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.

Anything critical, true or not is often met with scorn, aggresion, ridicule, anger, personal attacks, bans and other insecure coping mechanisms. Dissent is discouraged.

&gt;No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement.

This applies to any cryptocurrency leaders/developers/exchanges/investment schemes who don't feel the need to be transparent with their faithful sheep. Disturbingly frequent. They also love to shame those who want more transparency, as if that was something undesirable in this presumably new paradigm of transparency.

&gt;Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions.

If I had a dollar for every post in r/bitcoin or other subs I saw that more or less belongs in this category I'd be eating restaurant meals every day. Doomsday speak, financial or societal collapse, fearmongering, hyperbitcoinization, fiat death, conspiracies about certain classes of people, conspiracies about evil government plots, conspiracies about people who are not in the cult, conspiracies about normal companies even. Seriously, obviously not everyone out there is a nutjob but crypto surely is a magnet for them.

&gt;There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil.

I've seen threads in which people who were expressing happiness they cashed out nice gains and increased their standard of living were met with ridiculous levels of scorn or even hostility. You cannot sell. You are not weak hands. Buy and hodl. Shame and guilt used as tools of peer pressure to not leave the group.

&gt;Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances.

I also seen a few stories of people who left the echo chambers or were banished from them, stop drinking the kool aid and were consistent in their assesment that being integrated in there feels fucking crazy right now that they're in the normal world and interacting with normal people.

&gt;There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader.

You don't need any of that. Just venture to any crypto subreddit and see the casual abuse towards those who think critically or not believe enough.

&gt;Followers feel they can never be ""good enough"".

This one is not applied too often because crypto dudes are overconfident dunning krugers but they still feel bad they're not in the 21 million club or 1 million club or some crap.

&gt;The group/leader is always right.

Goes without saying. Also is amplified 10 times more in altcoin subs. If there is a group leader, lead dev or whatever he's a GOD and his word is holy.

&gt;The group/leader is the exclusive means of knowing ""truth"" or receiving validation, no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible.

If you link a source outside of cult, it's fake news. If you quote somebody outside of cult, they're dumb, irrational, corrupt, they don't understand or they're lying and accumulating. If you have different opinion about certain values or policies then you're a shill or a morally bankrupt statist cuck. And so on and so forth. 

I'll add some other signs from other common signs

&gt;The group is elitist
&gt;Us vs Them mentality, othering techniques
&gt;Former members must cut ties with those outside the group
&gt;A requirement to socialize with fellow members only
&gt;Don't engage with outsiders

Again I've seen my fair share of groupthink and discussions where people talked about their non crypto friends who don't believe or understand and their fellow butters seriously encouraging them to stop associating with them, shaming them or suggesting engaging in other dumb behaviour that was cringe at best. I mean even the fucking ""nocoiners"" term is mega cringe and is often used super unironically as a slur. To a normal person this is fucking nuts. Have you ever been called nostocker for not having any stocks? Or nogolder for not owning gold? Or nobonder? Or some other dumb crap. 

For the heck of it I typed 'friends' in search bar and this is the first post that I find. From yesterday https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/f1iam4/talking_to_my_friends_who_have_no_bitcoin/ Seriously....There's tons of this shit out there and some portion of it without even a hint of irony.

Oh and I even seen morons who seriously suggested you should not hang out with your family members who do not believe. Fucking hell.

&gt;A preoccupation with acquiring new members
&gt;Additional members means additional money
&gt;A Preoccupation with money

Always recruiting, always evangelizing, always spreading the good word and getting more members to buy in and hodl.

Seriously I've seen so much garbage in cryptocurrency subreddits it's amazing how often it fits into one or more of these categories daily. Also it's super funny when those fully brainwashed cryptobros venture outside their echo chambers and interact with normal people in normal subreddits. I've seen quite a few interactions, they often feel insecure about criticism and other kind of behavior  that is not allowed in their beloved echo chambers  and launch bizarro rants and tirades, berating or 'educating' ignorant plebes which quickly turns into lynches and public shaming displays as everyone laughs at those wackos.

##Premium Snapchat Subscription


This gives you access to my Premium Snap story. This may include: photos and videos of me nude, teasing, public exposure, day to day updates, premium only sales, and more! I have been having a great and wild time, and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day, for over a year and a half! For premium subscribers (and only at my discretion) I will open content sent to me, although I may not always respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

**SCREENSHOTS are NOT permitted on either the free or premium story!**

Subscription|Price
:--|:-:
1 Month|$30
3 Months|$60
12 Months|$90

-----

##Skype Shows

**All Skype shows MUST be reserved and paid for at least 24 hours in advance**

It's been a while since I offered cam shows, but for a limited time only I will be available for live cam shows done over Skype!!!! Each show is subject to individual pricing, but the general pricing is as follows:


* Clothed chat - $5/min
* Topless JOI - $6/min
* Nude JOI - $8/min
* Nude JOI /w pussy play - $10/min

* Voyeur/Hidden Cam/Ignoring Fetish $4+/min
* Fetish/Domme/Roleplay - $7+/min

If you're interested in setting up a show please PM me with the type of show you're looking for, the desired length, when you would like to do the show, and which payment method you intend to use. In order to setup the show in a timely manner it is important that you send **ALL** of the required information. 

**All Skype shows must be a minimum of 15 minutes!**

--------------

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! 😉

###All kik sessions MUST be a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure we have enough time to have fun 

----

##Cock &amp; Cumshot Ratings

###Options for Cock Ratings :

Rate|Price

All ratings vary in length depending on how much I have to say but will include a 1-10 rating as well as a detailed review about its appearance, what I would do with it, and my overall satisfaction. Ratings are not intended to be interactive so please refrain from making any requests. I do not provide any pics/vids to help you get ready for your rate but I encourage you to check out r/LaineyLove to get yourself rock hard 😉

#Girlfriend Experience

**Types of GFE available**

* New crush (general)
* Domination/Tasks/Fetish/Sissification
* Self-improvement/Dating Life Improvement
* Sugaring Arrangements (donation first ; see /r/sugarbaby)

Pricing

GFE|Rate|Description
:--|:--|:--
Low Interaction|$50/day, $250/week|This is my more affordable option. We will have light chat throughout the day periodically but you will be understanding that I'm often busy and I may take a little bit to reply. This is a relaxed arrangement without a whole lot of back in forth. Just a few check-ins a day and some occasional light chat.
Medium Interaction|$75-150/day|This is a middle of the road option where we talk as I'm available. You will occasionally receive photos with this option. With this option I am open to receiving any pictures of yourself you'd like to send including NSFW ones and will be more open to NSFW questions. 
High Interaction|$150+/day|This is a very involved GFE where I interact with you at a similar level to a significant other. Chat will be constant throughout the day unless I have matters to deal with or I am sleeping. I will reply as much as I possibly can. You will receive a mixture of live and gallery photos throughout the duration of the GFE because I love to show off for you!

On October 23, 2014, \[Blockstream goes public\]([https://blockstream.com/2014/10/23/why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream.html](https://blockstream.com/2014/10/23/why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream.html)) and announces funding and the formation of their company. Shortly after Blockstream was \[incorporated\]([https://archive.is/qzsVe](https://archive.is/qzsVe)), they received \[$50 million\]([https://www.crunchbase.com/funding\_round/blockstream-series-unknown--66d2817a#section-investors](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/blockstream-series-unknown--66d2817a#section-investors)) in venture capital from AXA, Khosla Ventures, Horizon Ventures, etc., some of the most powerful venture firms in the world. The \[Blockstream board of directors\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kflur/anybody\_ever\_find\_anything\_interesting\_in\_these/dre1508/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kflur/anybody_ever_find_anything_interesting_in_these/dre1508/)) are all bankers.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Summer of 2015, all of the primary Bitcoin communities such as /r/Bitcoin, mailing lists, Bitcoin Talk, wikis, etc., began \[massive censorship campaigns\]([https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43)) against any and all topics that had to do with scaling Bitcoin beyond the 1MB limit which, by the way, was temporarily added by Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2010 as a stop-gap measure to prevent spam in the early days.

&amp;#x200B;

When you do your own research, you will find that the Bitcoin name and repository were hijacked by a for-profit organisation so they could make a buck on their own patented and convoluted ""solution"" for a problem that doen't even exist (in fact; they themselves created it). In this process, Bitcoin (BTC) was turned into an altcoin by implementing SegWit (the coin itself is no longer a “chain of digital signatures,” as per Fig. 1 of the white paper).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: \[Blockstream fucked Bitcoin over\]([https://youtu.be/jctc85X\_PCI?t=79](https://youtu.be/jctc85X_PCI?t=79)) and r/Bitcoin bans people talking about it.

Other than the horrible price action, I finally got fed up with the constant selling by Ripple and unfulfilled promises by Brad the CEO specifically. Ethereum is really the only other crypto that I had spent a good amount of time looking at. It's hard to filter through all the over-hyped shitcoins and real projects. Although when doing so, one of the things I kept seeing was the fact that these projects are built on Ethereum. I still want to be greedy and chase pumps, but to me, it seems that most of this market leads right back here.

Just recently I started coming to this sub and am so thankful for all the nice people and information that I've gathered in the past few days. Learning about Defi was the tipping point for me. I truly believe now that this market is pretty much built up of Bitcoin (Trading/First movers advantage), and then Ethereum. While there are some legit separate projects out there, most of them seem to be built off of or working with Ethereum. While I truly hope we see some unreal gains in the future, the best thing about this change is knowing that I'm finally part of a real life-changing project, with arguably the best community in this whole space. 

I know it's not good to be close to 100% in anything, even ETH, but I think crypto as a whole is very risky, so I chose what I think is the best option by far.

People think the stock market consists of individual investors perusing over individual stocks and then deciding to place their money with stocks they deem will be worth more in the future.  

They actually make up a tiny amount of the volume of buys and sells.   

The majority of the volume is passive investing and stock buy-backs.  

There's a ""shadowy"" side to it in that hedge funds can move the market with big buys and sells, and there's also a connection between them and the government (the Fed bailing out the Repo market is a good example of that).  

The notion of ""fair value"" has gone out the window.  The DJIA has decoupled from the real economy many years ago.  It's on an unprecedented 11 year bull run, fuelled also by ZIRP (corporate debt at all time high, cheap money is used by companies to buy back their own stock).  Trump is calling for negative interest rates so the US can ""remain competitive"" with other countries.  It's all a shitshow.  

Sure, it could be argued that the little retail investor should just go along for the ride, but I would be very wary of doing so.  You could be losing a ton of money buying the top (or near the top).  IF there is to be more upside to the extent that we might see the DJIA at 40,000+, then it means the USD is going to be further trashed via more printing, and the US is piling up way more debt than it can pay back.

I know some people who didn't even know you could buy those items from a trader, that's how bad the situation is. 

The whole price hike was a stupid idea from BSG really, certainly for ammo, since you can only buy AP 6.3 at 180 rounds per 3 hours at 4.6$ per bullet, which is only enough rounds for ONE run with an MPX or MP5 every 3 hours, so its better off buying them and reselling them on flea than using them!

It really has ruined the market for most lower level players or even those with no know how to generate enough money in game to actually purchase those items in the the first place. Making the gap between the ultra wealthy in game and the poor insanely huge. Then tac on the level gap, and you have this nightmare of an economic disaster. 

I have been saying it since interchange was added to the game, and when they nerfed the KIBA store. That their way of altering the economy is incredibly bad and from the standpoint of a programmer not that of someone who understands even simple economic principles. People think things are ""OP"" or ""BROKEN"" and cry about it not knowing how not broken or not OP it actually is, then they break it in the opposite way by making it useless or redundant. For instance the amount of people misusing the fleamarket right now, selling things WELL UNDER the price you can sell them to a trader, while also taking a PENLTY for putting the item up. I see people put Bitcoin up for 140k, when it sells to therapist for 151k, and putting up a bitcoin at 140K costs 6200 rubles, that is with my 30% discount for intel center!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; The core design principle behind the merchant score is that it needs to indicate how reliable a merchant is while being based on qualities that cannot be faked.  As such, a merchant’s score is directly proportional tohow much Ultra they have burned on the network, which can only increase when the merchant either fulfillsorders or when the merchant commits resources to their reputation by directly burning Ultra (noting thatplacing fake orders with one’s self is equivalent to committing a direct burn of Ultra,  the latter of whichis allowed and encouraged).  This metric has the key benefit that a merchant with a high score either gotthat way through positive interactions with users or through investing a lot of capital into the system, thelatter of which doesn’t make sense as an investment unless one is expecting to fulfill a lot of orders. 

The second line of defense, which is in some ways more interesting, is that people are not obligated to use the scoring function I initialized the system with. Anybody who wants can develop their own scoring metrics and push an alternative client (maybe even charge for them if they want) on the grounds that they will do a better job separating the wheat from the chaff for its users (indeed, you can even write your own such filters). If there are as many such alternatives as there are Bitcoin clients, for example, with each client taking a different approach to ranking/spam-fighting, I would argue you wind up with a much more robust ecosystem than you could ever get with the ""mono-culture"" approach currently adopted by the surveillance capitalists.",,2020-02-11 06:28:48,1581398928,,{},fha6vg0,True,t3_f22nta,False,True,t1_fha58ll,/r/privacy/comments/f22nta/xpost_from_rcompsci_im_launching_the_first_truly/fha6vg0/,1581398930,1,True,False,privacy,t5_2qhlc,0

In r/Buttcoin, most people seem to know the value of education and hard work.  In r/Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency subs, you will find a huge percentage of people that are delusional, greedy, and/or get rick quick types who regularly hate work and education.

The German word for ""to mail"" is ""mailen"" and the word for ""electronic"" is ""elektronisch"" so the term email still makes linguistic sense. Now in languages like Russian, the common term is ""email"" because there's no short equivalent. The Russian verbiage would be the equivalent of saying ""electronic address"" or ""electronic post"" (elektronnyi adress / elektronnaya pochta) so it's simpler to just say email since everyone knows what you mean. 

For other examples, when the new invention has an English name, since English is so global, unless there's an equal term in the other language, usually the English term will be adopted. For example Bitcoin doesn't become ""bit-dinero"" in Spanish or any other language. It's just Bitcoin. Now the word ""cryptocurrency"" is adopted by most languages as a combination of ""crypto"" and the corresponding term for ""currency"". English also has plenty of foreign adopted terms especially when it comes to food.

Because I quite literally didn't have any fiat and did have the BTC.

&gt;Wouldn’t the Australian credit card be the most efficient method of paying for the trip?

It's equal in the end, but holding BTC exposes me to no fiat risk.

Imagine 1 BTC = $100.  There is something I want to buy that costs $50 and I can pay in either BTC or dollars.

Scenario 1: I have $100, and I want BTC.

1. I pay $50 for the thing, leaving me with $50 change.
2. I exchange my remaining $50 for 0.5 BTC.

Scenario 2: I have 1.0 BTC, and I want to keep as much of it as possible.

1. I pay 0.5 BTC for the thing, leaving me with 0.5 BTC.

In both cases, I end up with zero dollars and 0.5 BTC.  However, in the first scenario, I am exposed to risks that I am not exposed to in the second scenario:

* The value of BTC may increase prior to my opportunity to exchange dollars for BTC.
* The value of dollars may decrease prior to my opportunity to exchange dollars for BTC.
* The transaction may be blocked by a third party (e.g. bank) if the ""thing"" that I'm paying for is something that they don't like/agree with.
* The transaction may be recorded by a third party (e.g. bank) and used against me later when the ""thing"" that I'm paying for becomes something that they don't like/agree with.

To note, I did use the credit card for several things on that trip, including the hotel since I couldn't find a good family friendly hotel in Tokyo that accepts Bitcoin (only smaller ones that I'd be fine staying in myself alone, but not with wife and kids).  That exposes me to the latter two of the four fiat risks for those specific transactions, but at least it's not all of them.",,2020-02-11 06:03:59,1581397439,,{},fha53bj,False,t3_f1wb9f,False,True,t1_fh9mno6,/r/Bitcoin/comments/f1wb9f/help_me_understand/fha53bj/,1581397441,1,True,False,Bitcoin,t5_2s3qj,0

I have yet to see any data to prove it is being used for anything else. It is certainly what is used on the dark web - right? other than monero? That was its use case at first. If you check your six in seems to be the go to method. It has a degree of protection from both law and banks. They are synonymous in most cases. 

&gt;I've gotta say that I can't trust banks, though. With the daily lending which essentially equates to quantitive easing which has been taking place on a daily basis for the past 6 months scares me.
&gt;

    Scares you more than bitcoin volatility and its unproven performance in a down market? I think it is going to need more adoption to survive a downmarket. We don't know because it hasnt happened. I am willing to bet most people will need to sell their BTC to pay of houses. 

    Does it scare you more knowing bitmain manufactures mining equipment, is the largest miner, has been around since day 1, and has incentive to shoot the price down to starve off competition? This is what happened in the crypto winter dip. How about the fact that most of this mining operations are in china and that Bitmain is a Chinese company. The majority of what I have read shows that its main flows are money being laundered out of china. This is not centralized.  

    How about that most reports shows that most of the trading is ""fake"" meant to boost liquidity ratios and make it look like there is more adoption? 

    I am not a believer that bitcoin is diversified enough across different actors, motivations, and incentives. There are people out there with the ability to manipulate price so why wouldn't they? 

&gt;I don't understand ""why"" my fiat is worth anything. And that they can continually print money as they see fit makes me not want to hold it, as we know inflation causes the value of a dollar to decrease over time. But who says it holds value in the first place? Why?
&gt;

    The existential crisis that is currency. Its faith in the US government to have an incentive to keep it around and use it as an accounting system.

    You still get $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank in fed deposit bank insurance. This is huge for an individual. Small for a company. The average household only has 175k saved. 

    Saying that the US currency doesn't have value does not mean that bitcoin has value. This is a logical fallacy. US currency has value. It is the defacto for global trade. We are the global military hegemony.

Does it scare you more that no one ever talks about these things because the only people interested in bitcoin are investors who dont want to discuss actual reasons for price movements? It is always going up.

Now a poor country. It does ""liquidity injections"". Its money loses value. When US / ECB / Chinese do it. Things are fine and dandy. At least for now. 

I did think too that bitcoin like currency could be a reserve currency of the future. But I have feeling if that ever happens. The big players want somekind of special rules where they can manipulate it to their own advantage. 

It is good to be the king.

I do wonder though if the wheels fall off and people lose their trust in the currencies that are printed by a tanker load. You would think so.. Not that I wish for it to happen. 

Yet. If it happens. At that point it could be that to find stability, a new world currency is created / bitcoin is adopted as reserve currency by all. That would equalize the playing field and change the world fundamentally. 

I just can not see big players accept that. I think they would rather have a bitcoin type currency that they would create themselves. Maybe a true world bank that could not be swayed by any single country.

This is how it appears on the surface, but technically this isn't what is true. When you run a full-node it's true a certain history of transactions is downloaded. However, the node you run only receives *suggestions* as to what history of transactions will be the one you keep and don't discard. In other words, the ""blocks"" of transactions your node hears about, when attempting to synchronize itself to the current ledger version, must follow the rules of your node. Anybody at anytime can change those rules. This means the node may end up with one version of stored data, which it creates on the fly during synchronization, and later appends to, or it may end up with another.

An entire ""blockchain"" is only a mental construct making it easier to visualize this whole process.

&gt; Yes, you can put it on a USB stick and throw it in your briefcase.

No, you can't. You can't put the process I described into any briefcase. For example, let's say BitcoinABC added hard-fork code to fund developers which took effect February 15, 2020. This HF code said that every new block would pay 5 BCH to a wallet address belonging to BitcoinABC. Perhaps half the current BCH community accepted this change and upgraded to that software version. Another half the community didn't. My question to you is, what the heck is in your briefcase? See what I mean? Whatever is in any briefcase can't change.

In this context, being decentralized removes the necessity for trust, right? But how can you quantify and appraise a value of ""trust"", anyway? 

In the case of Bitcoin the only entity which could arise as a central authority would be an enclave of miners, such as is seen with the current networks hashrate being disproportionately computed by mining firms located within China. 65% of the mining is currently being performed there. If these people were to be acquired by an overarching authority, or if they were to begin to (or currently are) working cooperatively, they essentially control the network. It would be in their best interest to maintain the network in a trustworthy fashion, but the possibility still arises that a malevolent actor could potentially disrupt the network or otherwise inflict harm upon its users when so much of the computational power of the network is concentrated in a particularly dubious part of the world.

Anyway, in the standard context, ""trust"" is among the most valued things (beliefs) people have. It's said to be extremely easy to lose and extremely difficult to gain. 

You gain it in drops and lose it in buckets.

When it comes to a monetary system, being trustless removes the need for a central authority. This is untested on a large scale.

Guardian Circle is a private social network for safety. 

It’s like setting up your own 911. You and your network watch out for each other.

Whenever you feel in danger, push the Guardian Circle ALERT button. 

Your friends, family, and neighbors are ALL instantly assembled into a ‘situation room’ with a location-sharing map (showing where you are) and group chat.

“Is it serious enough to call 911?” Don’t debate: simply use Guardian Circle anytime you’re not comfortable.

Your network is usually closest and can help you fastest. 

Guardian Circle creates a ‘flash mob of help’ by alerting everybody at the same time using advanced technology and Uber-like location-sharing maps.

Your friends, family and neighbors can now communicate. Everybody knows where everybody else is. They can get to work on helping you fast. 

Life-saving information only your network knows can now flow quickly: where the key is hidden, who knows the dog, your allergies, etc. 

In mass-emergencies like earthquakes, fires, viruses, hurricanes, etc. 911 is frequently slow or unavailable -- but your Guardian Circle network can still help. 

Can’t text or talk? Your network is still alerted and can start mobilizing. 

Accidentally hit the Alert button? Or just want to try it out? No worries - there’s no penalty.  In fact, we encourage people to practice with Guardian Circle and run drills. 

Need to keep quiet? Guardian Circle lets you chat using only text to your network. 

On the go? We update your location even if you’re in a car or walking.

Use Guardian Circle for:

Women’s Safety \* Rural Areas \* Neighborhood Watch \* Elder Care \* Child Protection \* Hurricanes \* Earthquakes \* Fires \* Floods \* Slow Public Services \* Extra Protection \* Unsafe Cities \* Campuses 

Now you can earn GUARD Rewards for referrals and answering alerts. The bigger your Guardian Circle network, the more you can earn. 

GUARD is worth pennies today, just like Bitcoin was in 2009, so now is a good time to start earning. 

Features:

\- Supports multiple simultaneous Alerts (useful in mass-emergencies)

\- Full GUARD Rewards wallet in-app

\- Control who can see your Alerts

\- Control who can send you Alerts

\- Alert History: Review any Alert Transcript

\- Supports private and public Alerts. Your location is ONLY shared for Alerts (otherwise it is 100% private).",,2020-02-11 04:39:21,1581392361,,{},fh9y5no,False,t3_evpvi1,False,True,t3_evpvi1,/r/NEO/comments/evpvi1/what_dapps_are_currently_building_on_neo/fh9y5no/,1581392603,1,True,False,NEO,t5_2qky3,0

I dont have too much time for this but store of value is mostly used to hedge against depreciation. Bitcoin does not ""depreciate"" but it is net negative given it needs electricity. This is a small cost of doing business but it will have huge effects on future pricing. 

&gt;(60% is used for jewelry and gold coins in the US, well over 80% for the world (the world is bigger than the US)
&gt;

Show the source of the 60%. I am seeing different numbers but they are all over the place.

&gt;(store of value is the biggest factor for gold. It is used far more as a store (coins and jewelry) than it is used industrially) 
&gt;

Depends who you are talking to. Depends who is pricing it. Depends how they are valuing it. My point being that its price is a reflection of intrinsic value.

&gt;(bitcoin only sits if you hold it. I used Bitcoin (and monero) every single day as a currency. You cannot use gold as a currency. no one accepts it)
&gt;

Its a commodity. no use it getting into this argument.

&gt;(lb for lb doesn't mean anything. 38% is still used in jewelry in the US. it doesnt matter what weight lol)
&gt;

Yes it does because one lb of gold is used differently in other locations. It has a unqiue density property. Gold is a crazy element. This is why price fluctuations are difficult. Most of the price is baked into its ability to derisk, and hedge depreciation.

&gt;(you can break down a bitcoin into many, many satoshis)
&gt;

Trolling, irrelevant.

&gt;(yes, used mostly as jewelry or coins. all materialistic things. Ironic you call bitcoin a collectible, but gold is used more than bitcoin as a COLLECTIBLE)
&gt;

No, mostly used as gold bullion / ingot (kind of) 


My main point being that gold is a shitty comparison to bitcoin.

&gt;Gold is a fiat commodity currency (with insignificant intrinsic value). Bitcoin is a fiat virtual peer-to-peer currency (without intrinsic value).
&gt;

You can look up gold bullion investing. Thats your best use case. Gold bullion primarily has value because of all of its functional use cases and its network effect of being used as a trading commodity (which is mostly boosted by its use as a functional resource).

I was separating gold bullion. I admit it is confusing.

coinage is different from jewelry which different from store of value but they are heavily related. 

I have never said that bitcoin does not have value or should not be purchased.

I was saying that it is a very different asset from bitcoin. 

ruthenium is not a great example. 
&gt;Palladium, platinum, and silver are the closest replacement metals for gold but are not a direct substitute.

The halvening at this point is the least important piece of analyzing price in today’s market. 

Point 1 - green cross incoming, possible golden cross. If you look at the 5year, or 1 year, price chart with RSI you see the 50 day sma about to cross the 100 day sma. The last 3 times we saw this happen we had some very positive price trends. I have concluded that now is a good time to buy more because if it crosses, we’ll see a large price increase. If it does not cross, I have saved some cash to buy more and average but I’m confident we will cross soon bc of pt 2-3 below. 

Point 2 - Coranavirus impact on global markets. Lot of discourse here on if global markets and crypto have a correlation.  I’ll tell you one thing, I’ve seen when there’s a big equity sell off, there’s a big commodity buy. This virus is going to generally ruin companies earnings who have a large China stake. For example, they are projecting Apple and Nike greater China earnings to suffer by up to 50%. This is going to cause a real equity market sell off. We will see a move into commodities. This is going to drive up demand. 

Point 3 - bitcoin futures. The average daily volume in the may futures is wild right now. The current highs are scaling throughout the current year up to 14k by year end. Mar closed at 10.1, June closed at 10.3 today. 

Point 4 - halvening impact on supply. Frankly I don’t think this is going to impact price as much this year. The points i mentioned above are going to rise the price over the next roughly year. As the price scales up, I actually anticipate people with heavy bags to sell off . 


Conclusions - I think price predictions at this point are safe to say the 10k - 15k range is a very realistic possibility within the year followed by a sell off if we hit 15k. I’m calling an eventual rise to 15k and then a sell off establishing 10k as the new support. We won’t get a new ATH until 10k is set as the bottom support line and there’s going to need to be a lot of trading before we get there. 

Expect a roughly 1.5 year time line prior to testing new ATH but this is pure speculation given above and current market conditions.

As far as ownership goes... After you buy bitcoin from the exchange, you need to withdraw the funds into an open-source non-custodial wallet. Otherwise there's no telling who has access to your money. Here are a few free apps that are safe and easy to use.

Yes, you lose some flexibility in terms of investment options - you can invest in just anything, it has to be an OZ fund.

Can’t have stuff shipped to an address (even a PO Box) if you don’t provide it. There are limitations on the IRS, and sure, plenty of people will get by under the radar, despite there being plenty of evidence to figure out exactly who they are, but I’m specifically talking about “significant” amounts of bitcoin. A couple hundred to thousands of dollars is nothing and isn’t worth pursuing as you’ve said. I’m specifically talking about the “when lambo? Probably after my boating accident” people. Coinbase had to submit data, and I suspect we’ll continue to see more and more releases of information for tax verification purposes (or exchanges/businesses will just stop accepting US customers, which several already do).

I’m glad you’re not one of those people (hopefully referring to my entire statement, and not only the part you quoted), but that’s not the majority of people here (at least the vocal majority). I don’t particularly see bitcoin as outside their jurisdiction, but more like foreign currency, which certainly falls within the IRS’s jurisdiction. If you make transactions (income, profit, whatever), it doesn’t matter what “currency” you get, that’s what’s taxed. The benefit of treating bitcoin like a foreign currency rather than property is the “small transactions aren’t taxed” part. As long as you make small purchases, you aren’t held responsible for calculating capital gains, which would be an ideal situation for bitcoin.
