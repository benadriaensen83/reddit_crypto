The bitcoin project was designed in a way that it could, conceivably, store value if it caught on. That's why things like scarcity and fungibility was built into it. That doesn't mean it was destined to succeed at storing value, simply because it was designed to be able to. You still need participants and a market. But at least it started with a good framework. Bear with me.

With no real market or valuation in the early days, it didn't exactly store value in any meaningful sense. But because the groundwork had been laid, people saw an opportunity to buy as a means of speculation. This speculation was essentially self-fulfilling - it became profitable because other people were speculating. That's how bubbles work. We've seen 3 distinct ones.

However, keep in mind these aren't beanie babies. Yes speculation fueled things to get to this point, but look at where we are now. Maybe you aren't personally finding a usefulness for holding and transferring bitcoins - but I can assure you that many individuals are. And they tend to be on the wealthier side.

Whether you like it or not, it has slowly been developing into a unique asset that many people are discovering is functional to them for various reasons. Is it perfect for everyone? No, but it doesn't need to be. That's why we have many different assets, currencies, commodities. Bitcoin just happens to be another one. It is evolving not towards what people want it to be, but what it excels at. Storing and moving large amounts of value in a decentralized manner.

I don't think you're dumb. If I did I probably wouldn't have replied at all. I just think you're being stubborn. So to address your question directly:

&gt; how speculative-investing alone will EVER create a \*stable\* BTC 

It won't. What speculative investing has created however is exposure, capital for development, and a large network of participants. Speculating has taken it from nothing to something. It did (and is still doing) exactly what it was supposed to do for all parties involved. People speculated with their capital thinking down the road, the network would be further fleshed out and valuable. It is not so unlike any publicly-traded startup with negative profits but rising stock price from speculation.

You can't deny that it's a lot more useful today than it was in 2011. Again, maybe you aren't someone who actually sees the point in holding bitcoin besides to get explosive gains. But there are plenty of people who are already starting to consider it legitimate enough to be a part of their broader portfolio. Because of it's unique decentralized and psuedo-anonymous properties, it represents potential diversification and hedges that many want exposure to.

I simply feel you aren't viewing it with an open-mind to understand where it is now and why. You want it to have a stable price and have widespread adoption, but in the same breath are treating speculation as completely pointless. How is it supposed to get from A to Z without steps B, C, D... in the meanwhile?

It will never be completely stable because the world is never completely stable. But as it develops further, the speculative upside goes down. As speculation goes down, volatility goes down as the price begins to represent more what the value of the network actually is rather than what it could potentially be. In the beginning it was very exciting but not particularly useful. In the end, it may become not particularly exciting but very useful. Such is the course of new technology.",,1581433011,{},fhb22b6,False,t3_f1pl3d,False,True,t1_fhax98h,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/f1pl3d/bitcoin_has_only_been_above_10000_for_170_days_of/fhb22b6/,1581433013,1,True,False,BitcoinMarkets,t5_2wwh3,0,2020-02-11 15:56:51,,
